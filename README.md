# Vault

Minimal Obsidian vault structure.

## Top-level

- `001 - inbox/` — items created by the assistant that require Batman’s attention (use the inbox template).
- `001 - daily notes/` — daily logs.
- `002 - research/` — research knowledge base (migrated from `003 - genesis/research`).
- `008 - templates/` — note templates (MOC, Zettel, Inbox).
- `/` — archived legacy folders from the previous vault structure.

## Notes

- Community plugins are disabled (minimal setup). Core settings remain under `.obsidian/`.
