## Assignment One

On using a web app that estimates the beats per minute using tap tempo, I was able to determine the tracks tempo to be 131 bpm by listening to it. Using the library the estimated tempo was seen to be 129.20 bpm. For `track04`, Sour Le Vent, the library estimated the tempo to be 143.55 bpm whereas I counted it be 71 bpm, I might have been counting at double the beats or the library was counting half beats. I noticed it is harder to estimate the tempo of music that had more prominent vocals and less drums.
