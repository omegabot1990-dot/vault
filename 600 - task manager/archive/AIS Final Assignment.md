**The Final Assignment**   
The task is to re-imagine what AI could be (in a hopeful/novel way?) within a specific domain (options listed below). It asks you to incorporate social critique used in the course to think about what could be done differently and what kind of social change that could lead to. You are encouraged to be speculative and playful - you can rethink interfaces, narratives, categories, concepts, redistribution of wealth, whose knowledge counts, etc. The value will be in the quality of your analysis and (re-)conceptualisation, not in the technical implementation.

The final project consists of three parts and constitutes 50% of your course grade:   
-    (1) Proposal depicting your alternative vision (can take various forms, such as a conceptual prototype, interface mockup, film or animation, poster; 40% of the grade)   
-    (2) Presentation of this proposal (in-class 27.12 and 04.12; 20% of the grade);   
-    (3) Written Individual Report (40% of the grade). 

The development of the Proposal and Presentation can also be done in pairs. The report is individual and can be based on your Assignments 1-5. 

**Possible domains:**   
Creative Industries  
Healthcare & Medicine  
Care & Intimacy  
Environment  
Governance  
Labour  
Military  
Religion   
Food production  
*These domains here are defined broadly. You are expected to zoom in to specific areas/fields or practices within that domain for your project. 

**Part 1: The Proposal** 

The proposal is your answer to the question – what could AI be, or what needs to change about the way AI is being currently understood/developed so that it leads to a different (better?) world? Your re-imagination of what/how AI could be should present itself as an alternative to existing practices.The aim of your proposal is to deliver (social) critique through a speculative and imaginative lens rather than focusing on realistic implementation. You are encouraged to be speculative and playful - you can rethink interfaces, narratives, categories, concepts, redistribution of wealth, whose knowledge counts, etc. It can take various forms, such as a conceptual prototype, interface mockup, film or animation, poster. Make sure that the form aligns with the concept. 

_Questions guiding the evaluation of the Proposal:_   
•    Does the proposal effectively critique current AI applications/approaches to AI and/or their societal implications? Does it propose an alternative vision that addresses this issue?   
•    Is the addressed issue pressing and relevant in the selected domain?  
•    Does the proposal provoke discussion or encourage the audience to rethink existing assumptions about AI in a substantial way?  
•    Does it question the status quo and highlight overlooked perspectives?  
•    Are the main ideas and critiques clearly understandable, allowing the audience to grasp the intended message?   
•    Is the proposal engaging - does it consider the audience and, for example, use playfulness or unconventional storytelling to emphasise its social critique?  
•    Is the chosen format of the proposal aligned with the message of the proposal?   
•    Do the elements in the proposal contribute meaningfully to the delivery of the critique or enhance the proposal’s impact?

  
**Part 2: The Presentation**

Each team will have up to **5** **min** to present their work. Each presentation should: 

1. Clearly explain the problem with current AI development that you have identified and that you want to challenge through your work. Explain the broader relevance of this problem (up to 1 min)
2. Showcase your proposal for intervention ( approx 3 min) and
3. Clearly articulate in what ways the proposal addresses the problem you have identified and how it challenges the status quo (up to 1min). 

5 min is really not a lot of time, so I recommend preparing for the presentations well by rehearsing and timing them. I have indicated how you can allocate time for which section - it is just an indicator. 

For each presentation, five other students in the audience will be assigned to provide feedback and post a question online. 

  
**Part 3: Written Individual Report**   
   
•    Describe the current situation in your domain and what changes AI is expected to bring about, as discussed in the popular press. (300-500 words max)  
•    Zoom in on the concerns and the critique aimed at current AI applications/approaches to AI that you want to address. Explain what issues regarding the status quo the critique challenges. What actors/practices/institutions/norms & values (aka socio-technical system) are involved in maintaining it – try to ground it to real places and contexts, using concrete examples rather than staying at an abstract level. Explain who is benefitting more from the status quo, who is less, and maybe also who is harmed. Provide a good overview of the concerns/critique and how they relate to the problem they want to address. Who is resisting the critique, and who is welcoming it? (800-1000 words)  
•    Introduce your ‘intervention’/ re-articulation of what AI could be (your Proposal). Explain how it addresses the challenge you have identified. Explain how it provides or aligns with the critique of current AI applications/approaches to AI and/or their societal implications within your domain. (400-800 words max)  
•    Reflect on the role of speculative interventions such as this project have in creating alternative visions about AI. More specifically, what doing this project has meant for your own thinking about what AI is and what it could be. (300-500 words)   
•    Incorporate references where appropriate. (External to word count)  
•    Can be based on your previously submitted assignments.  
•    Has to be submitted along with the Proposal (or a link to your Proposal if the file itself can not be uploaded).
