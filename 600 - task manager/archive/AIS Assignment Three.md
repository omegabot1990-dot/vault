Using literature and independent search, please formulate answers to the following questions: 

1) Can you establish what data AI systems of your interest (in your domain) rely on? What concerns regarding biases would you have, considering what we have discussed in class and what you know about your domain?  (Approx. 200 words)  
      
2) Drawing on insights from Bechmann and Bowker (2019) and Henriksen and Bechmann (2020), explain how the choices and interpretations made by developers (and the institutions they represent) shape the construction of "truth" in AI systems. Relate these insights to your domain. (Approx. 300 words)

3) Why, according to Roger A. Søraa (2022), intersectional approach to AI development is essential? How would you see that relevant in your domain? (Approx. 300 words)
