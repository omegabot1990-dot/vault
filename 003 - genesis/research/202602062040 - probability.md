- Probability is the mathematical field concerned with reasoning under uncertainty [^1]
	- Probability is a numerical way to measure how "likely" it is that an event will occur
	- It is the language we use to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantify uncertainty</mark>
- The probability of an event $A$ is the ratio of the number of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:

> [!MATH] Probability
> 
> $$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of ways A can happen}}{\text{Total number of outcomes in Sample Space}}$$

- Axioms
	- Range
		- $0 \le P(A) \le 1$ (0% to 100%) [^4]
	- Certainty
		- $P(S) = 1$ (something in the sample space *must* happen) [^5]
	- Additivity
		- For two events that can't happen at once, $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$ [^6]
- Interpretation
	1. Frequentist (The "Repeater")
		1. Probability is what happens if you repeat an experiment millions of times
		2. If you flip a coin forever, 50% will be heads
	2. Bayesian (The "Believer")
		1. Probability is a degree of belief
		2. If I say there is a 70% chance of rain, I am describing my <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">personal certainty based on the evidence</mark> I have right now
- Given a probabilistic model of some process, we can reason about the [[202602061241 - likelihood|likelihood]] of various events [^2]
- Probabilities are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">theoretical quantities</mark> that underly the data-generating process [^3]
