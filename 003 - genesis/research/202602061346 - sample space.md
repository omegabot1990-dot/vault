- The sample space is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complete set of every single possible result or outcome</mark> that can happen in a [[202602061354 - random experiment|random experiment]] [^1]
- Rules
	1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Mutually Exclusive</mark>
		1. Two outcomes from the sample space cannot happen at the exact same time (e.g., a coin cannot be both Heads and Tails simultaneously)
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Collectively Exhaustive</mark>
		1. The list must cover *every* possibility
		2. Nothing can happen that isn't already on the list
	3. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Total Probability</mark> 
		1. The probabilities of all items in the sample space must add up to exactly 1 (or 100%)
- Example,
	- Coin Flip
		- $S = \{H, T\}$ (Heads or Tails)
	- Die Roll
		- $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
	- Deck of Cards
		- $S = \{\text{all 52 individual cards}\}$
