## Core Concepts

The Cornell Note-Taking system involves three main components: Cue, Notes, and Summary.

* **Cue**: Questions, keywords, and concepts that summarise the notes
  
* **Notes**: Facts, figures, and important information
  
* **Summary**: A brief overview of the key points

This method has several benefits:

* Enhances comprehension and retention
  
* Organises information effectively
  
* Simplifies review and study

Some tips for effective note-taking using this system include:

* Be selective; only take down main ideas, key details, and connections between concepts
  
* Review regularly to reinforce learning
