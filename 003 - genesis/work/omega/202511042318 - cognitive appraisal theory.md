Cognitive Appraisal Theory = the idea that **emotion is not just a raw reaction** — it is shaped by how you *interpret* what is happening.

---

### Core concept

Two people can face the same event → but feel different emotions because they **appraise** (interpret, evaluate) the situation differently.

**Example**
You see a dog running toward you.

* If you appraise it as “friendly dog → wants to play” → you feel happy/excited.
* If you appraise it as “danger → might bite” → you feel fear.

So the emotion is not produced just by the stimulus.
**The emotion is produced by your interpretation of the stimulus**.

### Origin

* Proposed by **Richard Lazarus**
* 1960s → influential in psychology and affective science

### The two stages of appraisal

| Stage                   | What it means                                                | Output                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Appraisal**   | Is this situation relevant to me? Is it good or threatening? | Motivate emotion valence (good, harm, threat, challenge)                |
| **Secondary Appraisal** | Do I have the resources to cope with it? Can I handle it?    | Influences intensity and emotion type (anger, fear, challenge, anxiety) |

### Why it matters

This theory says:

> 🔹 **Emotions are not automatic.**
> 🔹 They are the result of thinking → interpreting → evaluating.

Therefore → if you change your appraisal (thought), you **change your emotion**.

This is precisely the logic behind CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy).

### In the modern Affective Computing / AI context

* It is the basis for many **computational emotion models** today.
* Used to design agents that **infer emotional states** from appraisals of events, goals, and beliefs.
* Useful in your domain: "context-aware emotional journaling/reflection assistant".

### One-sentence summary

> Cognitive Appraisal Theory says emotions come from *how we interpret situations*, not from the situations themselves.
