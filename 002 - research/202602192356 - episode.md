- An episode is one complete trajectory of agent-environment interaction from start state to terminal condition
- It consists of a sequence of states, actions, rewards, and transitions
- Episodic tasks reset after termination, producing many episodes for training
- Episode return is the cumulative (possibly discounted) reward within that trajectory
- Episode length can be fixed by horizon limits or variable by environment termination rules
- Training statistics are often reported per episode, such as average return and success rate
