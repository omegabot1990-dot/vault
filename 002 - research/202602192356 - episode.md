- An episode is one complete trajectory of [[202602192343 - agent|agent]]-[[202602192345 - environment|environment]] interaction from start state to terminal condition
- It consists of a sequence of [[202602192351 - state|states]], [[202602192350 - action|actions]], [[202602192352 - reward|rewards]], and [[202602200013 - transition|transitions]]
- Episodic tasks reset after termination, producing many episodes for [[202602111335 - training|training]]
- Episode [[202602192355 - return|return]] is the cumulative (possibly discounted) [[202602192352 - reward|reward]] within that trajectory
- Episode length can be fixed by horizon limits or variable by environment termination rules
- Training statistics are often reported per episode, such as average return and success rate
