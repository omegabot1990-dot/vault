- A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Distribution</mark> is a mathematical function or "map" that tells you all the possible values a [[202602061340 - random variable|random variable]] can take and how frequently (or likely) they occur [^1]
- For discrete data, we use the [[202602091258 - probability mass function|Probability Mass Function]]
- For continuous data, we use the [[202602091301 - probability density function|Probability Density Function]]
- Examples
	- Uniform
		- Every outcome is equally likely (like a fair die).
	- [[202602072342 - normal distribution|Normal (Gaussian)]]
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The "Bell Curve" </mark>
		- Most outcomes are near the middle, and they get rarer as you move away (like human height)
	- Bernoulli
		- A single "yes/no" trial (like a coin flip)
	- Poisson
		- Counts how many times an event happens in a fixed time (like how many emails you get in an hour)
