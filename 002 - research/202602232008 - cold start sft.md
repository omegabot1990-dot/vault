- Cold start SFT is an initial supervised fine-tuning stage used before RL-style post-training
- It seeds the model with high-quality response patterns and stabilizes early optimization
- Training data usually contains curated instruction-response examples, often with reasoning-rich demonstrations
- This stage improves readability, format consistency, and baseline task competence before preference optimization
- In multi-stage pipelines, cold start SFT reduces failure modes seen in pure-RL initialization
- Final quality depends on data curation, coverage, and alignment between SFT targets and later RL objectives
