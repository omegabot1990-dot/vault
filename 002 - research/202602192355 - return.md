- In reinforcement learning, return is the cumulative future reward from a time step onward
- Return defines the optimization target for policies and value functions
- Discounting downweights distant rewards by a factor $\gamma\in[0,1)$

- Episodic return from time $t$:
  - $$G_t=\sum_{k=0}^{T-t-1}\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$

- Infinite-horizon discounted return:
  - $$G_t=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$

- Higher expected return indicates better long-term decision quality under the task objective
