- A t-statistic is a standardised score measuring how far an estimate is from a hypothesised value in units of estimated standard error
- It is used in t-tests and confidence intervals when the population variance is unknown
- Larger absolute t-statistics indicate stronger deviation from the null value

> [!MATH] Generic t-statistic form
> $$t=\frac{\hat{\theta}-\theta_0}{\operatorname{SE}(\hat{\theta})}$$

> [!MATH] One-sample mean t-statistic
> $$t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

- Under the null hypothesis and assumptions, $t$ follows a Student t-distribution with relevant degrees of freedom
- The t-statistic is converted to a p-value via the t-distribution
