- Training is the process of fitting [[202602111314 - model parameters|model parameters]] to data by minimising a [[202602010047 - objective function|loss function]]
- A training loop repeatedly runs <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">forward pass</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">loss computation</mark>, backpropagation, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">parameter updates</mark>
- Optimisation algorithms like SGD or Adam control how updates are applied
- Validation is used during training to monitor generalisation and tune hyperparameters
- Regularisation methods like weight decay and dropout help reduce overfitting
- Training stops when convergence criteria or budget limits are reached
