- The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified
- Also called ==sensitivity==
- $\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$
- Precision and recall often have an inverse relationship; increasing one often decreases the other

| **Accuracy**  | How often is the model correct overall?          | $\frac{(TP + TN)}{(TP + TN + FP + FN)}$ | Classes are balanced (50/50)   |
| **Precision** | Of all predicted positives, how many were right? |         $\frac{TP}{(TP + FP)}$          | You want to avoid False Alarms |
| **Recall**    | Of all actual positives, how many were caught?   |         $\frac{TP}{(TP + FN)}$          | You want to avoid Missed Cases |
