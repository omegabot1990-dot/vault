- Inference is the stage where a [[202602111335 - training|trained]] [[202602010044 - model|model]] is used to make predictions on new inputs
- During inference, [[202602111314 - model parameters|parameters]] are fixed, and no gradient updates are applied
- The main goals are prediction quality, low latency, and efficient resource use
- [[202602111625 - batch size|Batch Size]], precision, and hardware choice strongly affect inference throughput and cost
- For generative language models, the decoding strategy controls output quality and speed
- Common decoding methods are greedy decoding, beam search, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling
