- Off-policy reinforcement learning learns a target [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] from data generated by a different behaviour policy
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It enables the reuse of past experience and improves sample efficiency</mark> via replay buffers or logged trajectories
- [[202602201303 - q-learning|Q-learning]] and many [[202602201254 - actor-critic methods|actor-critic]] variants are off-policy methods
- [[202602072325 - distribution|Distribution]] mismatch between behaviour and target policies can introduce bias or instability
- Importance sampling and conservative update rules are common corrections for off-policy drift
- Off-policy learning is central when interaction is expensive or when large offline datasets are available
