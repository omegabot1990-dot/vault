- In statistical inference, a hypothesis is a precise claim about a population parameter or distribution
- Hypothesis testing compares a null hypothesis $H_0$ against an alternative hypothesis $H_1$
- $H_0$ usually encodes no effect or status quo, while $H_1$ encodes the effect of interest
- Evidence is summarized with a test statistic and a p-value under assumptions of the test model

- Decision rules often compare p-value to a significance level $\alpha$
- Statistical decisions should be interpreted with effect size, uncertainty, and assumptions
