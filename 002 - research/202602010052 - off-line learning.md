- **Offline Learning** is when learning takes place with the algorithm disconnected from the environment.

| Feature        | Online Learning                                 | Offline (Batch) Learning                         |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Usage** | Sequential stream, processes data as it arrives | Static dataset, trained on all data at once      |
| **Updating**   | Continuous, real-time updates                   | Requires full retraining to incorporate new data |
| **Storage**    | Low, data can often be discarded after use      | High, must store the entire training dataset     |
| **Best For**   | Dynamic trends (e.g., social media, finance)    | Stable patterns (e.g., image classification)     |
