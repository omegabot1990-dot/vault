## Summary

- Showed that LLMs can demonstrate sophisticated **reasoning** abilities
- These capabilities can emerge from ==pure outcome-based reinforcement learning without human-annotated reasoning trajectories==
	- Showed emergent self-reflection and dynamic strategy adaptation
- Released R1-Zero and R1
	- R1-Zero is similar to the original [[alphago zero|DeepMind AlphaGo Zero]]
- R1 Surpassed SOTA models in deterministic or verifiable domains like math, programming and STEM
- Evaluation used AIME 2024, pass@1
