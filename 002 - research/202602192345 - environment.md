- In reinforcement learning, the environment is the external system the agent interacts with
- It receives actions from the agent and returns next observations, rewards, and termination signals
- Environment dynamics define state transitions and reward generation, often modeled by an MDP
- The agent cannot directly control environment rules, only actions taken within them
- Environment stochasticity and partial observability strongly affect learning difficulty
- Benchmark environments provide standardized tasks for comparing RL algorithms
