- In [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning]], the environment is the external system that the [[202602192343 - agent|agent]] interacts with
- It receives actions from the agent and returns the next observations, rewards, and termination signals
- Environment dynamics define state transitions and reward generation, often modeled by an MDP
- The agent cannot directly control environment rules, only actions taken within them
- Environment stochasticity and partial observability strongly affect learning difficulty
- Benchmark environments provide standardized tasks for comparing RL algorithms
