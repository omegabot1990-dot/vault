- The environment is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">external system</mark> that the [[202602192343 - agent|agent]] interacts with
- It receives [[202602192350 - action|actions]] from the agent and returns the [[202602192351 - state|next observations]], [[202602192352 - reward|rewards]], and termination signals
- Environment dynamics define state [[202602200013 - transition|transitions]] and reward generation, often modelled by a [[202602192236 - markov decision process|Markov Decision Process (MDP)]]
- The agent cannot directly control environment rules, only actions taken within them
- Environmental [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochasticity]] and partial observability strongly affect learning difficulty
- Benchmark environments provide standardised tasks for comparing RL algorithms
