- A training technique where the [[202602111600 - learning rate|learning rate]] <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">starts small and gradually increases</mark> for a few steps or [[202602111623 - epochs|epochs]]
- Warmup is often used at the start to avoid instability when gradients are noisy
- Helps stabilise [[202602111335 - training|training]] in deep models before full-rate [[202602111605 - optimization algorithms|optimization]]
