- Variance measures <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">how "spread out" the data points are around the mean</mark>
- It is the average of the squared differences from the [[202602062110 - mean|Mean]]
- Average squared deviation from the mean:

> [!MATH] Variance ($\sigma^2$)
> $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

- Squaring
	- We square the differences so that negative distances don't cancel out positive ones
- Scale
	- Because it is squared, the units are also squared (e.g., if data is in "meters," variance is in "meters squared")
