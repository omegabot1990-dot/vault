- Regularization is a set of methods used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization
- It constrains model complexity or injects noise so the model learns robust patterns
- Common methods include weight decay, dropout, data augmentation, and early stopping
- Regularization strength is controlled by hyperparameters and must be tuned with validation data
- Too much regularization causes underfitting, while too little can cause overfitting
- Effective regularization depends on model size, dataset scale, and optimization setup
