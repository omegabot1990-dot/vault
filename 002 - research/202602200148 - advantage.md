- Advantage quantifies how much better an action is than the policy’s average action at a state
- It centers action values by subtracting the state value baseline
- Positive advantage means the action is better than expected under the current policy
- Advantage is widely used in policy-gradient updates to reduce variance and improve learning signal

- Definition:
  - $$A^\pi(s,a)=Q^\pi(s,a)-V^\pi(s)$$

- Practical estimators include temporal-difference residuals and generalized advantage estimation (GAE)
