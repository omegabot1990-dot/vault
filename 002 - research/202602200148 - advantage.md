- Advantage quantifies how much better an [[202602192350 - action|action]] is than the [[202602192245 - policy|policy’s]] average action at a [[202602192351 - state|state]]
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It centres action values by subtracting the state value baseline</mark>
- Positive advantage means the action is better than expected under the current policy
- Advantage is widely used in [[202602200129 - policy gradient methods|policy-gradient]] updates to reduce [[202602062206 - variance|variance]] and improve the learning signal
