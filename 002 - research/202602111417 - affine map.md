- An affine map is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">linear map followed by a translation</mark> [^1]
- It preserves straight lines, parallelism, and ratios on the same line
- It does not need to preserve the origin

> [!MATH] Affine map $T$
> An affine map from $\mathbb{F}^n$ to $\mathbb{F}^m$ has the form
> $$T(x)=Ax+b$$
> where $A\in\mathbb{F}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{F}^m$

- If $b=0$, the affine map reduces to a linear map
- Convex combinations are preserved
- For two points $x,y$ and $\lambda\in[0,1]$:

> $$$T(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y)=\lambda T(x)+(1-\lambda)T(y)$$
