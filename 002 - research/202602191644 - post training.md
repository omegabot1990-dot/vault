- Post training is the phase after base pre-training where a model is adapted for alignment and downstream behavior
- Typical stages include supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and safety tuning
- It improves instruction following, helpfulness, harmlessness, and task-specific performance
- Common methods include SFT, RLHF/RLAIF, DPO-family objectives, and rejection sampling pipelines
- Post training can significantly change model behavior without changing core architecture
- Trade-offs include capability retention, alignment tax, compute cost, and evaluation complexity
