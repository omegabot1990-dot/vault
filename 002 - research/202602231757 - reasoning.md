- Reasoning is the [[202602010044 - model|model’s]] ability to perform multi-step inference to derive answers beyond direct recall
- It often requires:
	- Decomposition
	- Intermediate consistency checks
	- Error correction across steps
- Reasoning quality is usually evaluated on math, logic, coding, and planning-style benchmarks
- Improvements come from better training signals, inference-time scaling, and [[202602191644 - post-training|post-training]] methods like [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|RL]]-based optimization
- Strong reasoning does not guarantee factuality, so grounding and verification remain necessary
- Practical systems combine reasoning with tools, retrieval, and constraint checks for reliability
