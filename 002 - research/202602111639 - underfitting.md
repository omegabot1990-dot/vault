- Underfitting happens when a model is too simple or too constrained to capture patterns in the training data
- It is characterised by high training error and high validation/test error
- Common causes are low model capacity, excessive regularization, or insufficient training time
- Typical fixes are increasing model capacity, reducing regularization strength, and training for more steps
- Better features, better architecture choices, or improved optimization can reduce underfitting
- Underfitting contrasts with overfitting where training error is low but validation error is high
