- Underfitting happens when a [[202602010044 - model|model]] is too simple or too constrained to capture patterns in the [[202602111335 - training|training]] data
- It is characterised by high training error and high validation/test error
- Common causes are low [[202602111314 - model parameters|model capacity]], excessive [[202602111636 - regularization|regularization]], or insufficient training time
- Typical fixes are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increasing model capacity</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">reducing regularization</mark> strength, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">training for more steps</mark>
- Better features, better architecture choices, or improved [[202602111605 - optimization algorithms|optimization]] can reduce underfitting
- Underfitting contrasts with [[202602010049 - overfitting|overfitting]] where training error is low but validation error is high
