- The span of a set of vectors is the set of all linear combinations of those vectors
- The span is always a subspace and is the smallest subspace containing the vectors

> [!MATH] Span of a set of vectors
> For vectors $v_1,\dots,v_k \in \mathbb{F}^n$:
> $$\operatorname{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\} = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k a_i v_i : a_i \in \mathbb{F}\right\}$$

- Membership test
	- Form the matrix $A = [v_1\ \cdots\ v_k]$
	- A vector $b$ is in the span iff the linear system $Ax=b$ has a solution

- Geometric intuition in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- One nonzero vector spans a line through the origin
	- Two linearly independent vectors span a plane through the origin
	- $n$ linearly independent vectors span all of $\mathbb{R}^n$

- Redundancy
	- A spanning set can contain linearly dependent vectors
	- A basis is a spanning set that is linearly independent
