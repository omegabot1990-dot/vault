- A large language model is a [[202602061153 - neural network|neural network]] [[202602111335 - training|trained]] on massive text corpora to model token sequences
- Most modern LLMs use [[202602102143 - transformer|transformer]] architectures with self-attention and next-token prediction objectives
- Pre-training learns broad linguistic and world knowledge, while post-training aligns behavior for downstream use
- Capabilities include generation, summarization, translation, coding, and reasoning with context-dependent quality
- Performance depends on model scale, data quality, compute budget, and training recipe
- Common limitations include hallucinations, bias, context-window constraints, and sensitivity to prompting
