- A large language model is a [[202602061153 - neural network|neural network]] [[202602111335 - training|trained]] on massive text corpora to model token sequences
- Most modern LLMs use [[202602102143 - transformer|transformer]] architectures with [[202602191531 - attention|self-attention]] and [[202602050155 - causal language modelling|next-token prediction]] objectives
- [[202602030230 - pre-training|Pre-training]] learns broad linguistic and world knowledge, while post-training aligns behaviour for downstream use
- Capabilities include generation, summarisation, translation, coding, and reasoning with context-dependent quality
- Performance depends on [[202602111314 - model parameters|model scale]], data quality, compute budget, and [[202602111335 - training|training]] recipe
- Common limitations include hallucinations, bias, context-window constraints, and sensitivity to prompting
