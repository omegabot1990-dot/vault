- Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a form of [[202602061145 - machine learning|machine learning]] where <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the model trains itself by creating its own labels from "unlabelled" raw data</mark>
- It effectively turns an [[202602112310 - unsupervised learning|unsupervised learning]] problem into a [[202602112328 - supervised learning|supervised]] one by hiding parts of the input and tasking the [[202602010044 - model|model]] with predicting those missing pieces
