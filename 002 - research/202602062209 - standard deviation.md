- Standard Deviation is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">square root of the variance</mark>
- It brings the measure of spread back into the original units of your data
- The "standard" distance a data point is from the mean:

> [!MATH] Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)
> $$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$$

- Interpretation
	- Low $\sigma$
		- Data is clustered tightly around the mean
	- High $\sigma$
		- Data is spread out over a wide range
