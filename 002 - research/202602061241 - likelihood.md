- The likelihood $L(\theta | x)$ is the probability of the observed data $x$ given parameters $\theta$
- For a set of independent observations $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$:

> [!MATH]
> $$L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | \theta)$$

- Probability [^1]
	- $\text{Prob}(\text{data} | \text{fixed parameters})$
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Probability predicts the future based on a fixed rule</mark>
- Likelihood [^1]
	- $\text{Like}(\text{parameters} | \text{fixed data})$
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Likelihood helps you guess the rule based on what you already saw</mark>
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is the process of finding the value of $\theta$ that makes the observed data $x$ as probable as possible (i.e., maximising the Likelihood) [^2]
