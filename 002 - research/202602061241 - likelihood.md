- The likelihood $L(\theta | x)$ is the probability of the observed data $x$ given parameters $\theta$ [^2]
- For a set of independent observations $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$:

> [!MATH] Likelihood
> $$L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | \theta)$$

	- $\text{Prob}(\text{data} | \text{fixed parameters})$

- Likelihood [^1]
	- $\text{Like}(\text{parameters} | \text{fixed data})$

- [[202602181227 - maximum likelihood|Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)]] is the process of finding the value of $\theta$ that makes the observed data $x$ as probable as possible (i.e., maximising the Likelihood) [^2]
