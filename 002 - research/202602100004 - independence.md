- Independence means that the occurrence of one [[202602092352 - event|event]] does not change the [[202602062040 - probability|probability]] of another event happening [^1]
- It means the events provide zero information about each other
- Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if,
1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The Product Rule</mark> [^3]
	1. The [[202602080100 - joint probability|joint probability]] is just the product of the individuals

> [!MATH]  Product Rule
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

2. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The Conditional Rule</mark> [^2]
	1. Knowing $B$ happened changes nothing about $A$  

> [!MATH] Conditional Rule
>    $$P(A | B) = P(A)$$

3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Reverse Conditional</mark> [^2]
	1. Knowing $A$ happened changes nothing about $B$ 

> [!MATH]  The Reverse Conditional
>    $$P(B | A) = P(B)$$
