- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Action value</mark> $Q^\pi(s,a)$ is the expected return after taking action $a$ in state $s$ then following $\pi$
- Value functions guide policy improvement by scoring long-term consequences of decisions
- Bellman equations relate values recursively through immediate [[202602192352 - reward|rewards]] and next-state values
- Value approximation is central in dynamic programming, [[202602201305 - temporal-difference algorithm|temporal-difference learning]], and [[202602201254 - actor-critic methods|actor-critic methods]] 

### State-Value Function $V^\pi(s)$
The value of a state $s$ under a policy $\pi$ is the **Expected Return** when starting in $s$ and following $\pi$ thereafter.

### [!ABSTRACT] 💡 Value vs. Reward
- **Reward ($r$)**: Given by the environment immediately after an action (e.g., "I found a coin!").
- **Value ($V$)**: The total future rewards you expect from that point on (e.g., "I'm in a room full of coins, so my current state has high value").

---

### Key Properties
- **The Goal**: In RL, we want to find the **Optimal Value Function** $V^*(s)$, which is the maximum possible value achievable from state $s$ by any policy.
- **V vs. Q**: 
    - $V(s)$ is the value of the **State** alone.
    - $Q(s, a)$ is the value of taking a specific **Action** in that state.
- **Relationship**: $V(s) = \max_a Q(s, a)$ (if following an optimal policy).
