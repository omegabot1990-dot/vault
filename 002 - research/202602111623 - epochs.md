- An epoch is one full pass through the entire [[202602111335 - training|training]] dataset
- The number of epochs is a training [[202602111256 - hyperparameters|hyperparameter]] that sets how many full passes are run
- More epochs usually reduce training loss, but too many can increase [[202602010049 - overfitting|overfitting]]
- Epoch count interacts with dataset size, batch size, and [[202602111605 - optimization algorithms|optimizer]] settings
- Validation metrics are used across epochs to decide early stopping or checkpoint selection
- In mini-batch training, one epoch contains multiple parameter updates
