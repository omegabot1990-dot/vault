- The Median is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">middle value when the data is sorted from smallest to largest</mark>
- The "centre" of the data distribution
- Calculation
	- Sort the data
	- If $N$ is odd, it's the middle number
	- If $N$ is even, it's the average of the two middle numbers
- Robustness 
	- It is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">resistant to outliers</mark>
- Example
	- In a room of 10 people where 1 is a billionaire, the [[202602062110 - mean|Mean]] wealth is huge, but the Median wealth accurately reflects the "typical" person
