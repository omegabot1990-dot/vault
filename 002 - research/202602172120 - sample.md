- A sample is a subset of observations drawn from a [[202602172113 - population|population]]
- Samples are used to estimate unknown population parameters
- Sample statistics include the sample [[202602062110 - mean|mean]], the sample [[202602062206 - variance|variance]], and the sample proportion
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Random sampling improves representativeness and reduces selection bias</mark>
- For observations $x_1,\dots,x_n$:

> [!MATH] Sample Mean $\bar{x}$
> $$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$

- While the population variance ($\sigma^2$) is the "true" spread, the sample variance ($s^2$) is calculated from your data:

> [!MATH] Sample Variance $s^2$ (The Estimator)
> $$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$
> 
> - **$\bar{x}$**: The sample mean
> - **$n$**: The number of observations in your sample
> - **$n - 1$**: This is known as **Bessel's Correction**

- Larger samples typically reduce estimator variance and improve confidence in inference
- Sampling design affects validity of conclusions as much as sample size
