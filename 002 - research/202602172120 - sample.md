- A sample is a subset of observations drawn from a population
- Samples are used to estimate unknown population parameters
- Sample statistics include sample mean, sample variance, and sample proportion
- Random sampling improves representativeness and reduces selection bias

> [!MATH] Sample mean and sample variance
> For observations $x_1,\dots,x_n$:
> $$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i, \qquad s^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$

- Larger samples typically reduce estimator variance and improve confidence in inference
- Sampling design affects validity of conclusions as much as sample size
