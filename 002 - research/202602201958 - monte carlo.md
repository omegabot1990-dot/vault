- Monte Carlo methods [[202602192359 - value estimation|estimate values]] or [[202602192355 - return|returns]] from <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">complete sampled trajectories</mark>
- They do not [[202602201335 - bootstrapping|bootstrap]] from current value estimates, instead using realised [[202602192356 - episode|episodic]] outcomes
- A [[202602192351 - state|state]] or [[202602192350 - action|action]] value is updated toward the empirical average return from visits
- Monte Carlo estimates are unbiased in [[202602061333 - expectation|expectation]], but can have high [[202602062206 - variance|variance]]
- First-visit and every-visit variants differ by how repeated state occurrences are handled in an episode
- Monte Carlo [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] evaluation and control are foundational for understanding [[202602201305 - temporal-difference algorithm|temporal-difference]] methods
