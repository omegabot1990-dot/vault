- Machine learning is a subset of [[202602061141 - artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]] focused on algorithms that can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">“learn” the patterns</mark> of training data and, subsequently, make accurate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inferences</mark> about new data [^1]
- This pattern recognition ability enables machine learning models to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">make decisions or predictions without explicit, hard-coded instructions</mark> [^1]
