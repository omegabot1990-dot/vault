- An action is a decision chosen by the [[202602192343 - agent|agent]] at a time step
- The action influences [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] transitions and future [[202602192352 - reward|rewards]]
- Action spaces can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">discrete, continuous, or hybrid</mark>, depending on the task
- A [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] defines how actions are selected from [[202602192351 - state|states]], [[202512271203 - deterministic|deterministically]] or [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochastically]]
- Action constraints and feasibility are task-dependent and can shape learning dynamics
- Choosing actions balances the exploitation of known rewards and the exploration of uncertain outcomes
