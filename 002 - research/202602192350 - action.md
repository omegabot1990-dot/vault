- In reinforcement learning, an action is a decision chosen by the agent at a time step
- The action influences environment transitions and future rewards
- Action spaces can be discrete, continuous, or hybrid depending on the task
- A policy defines how actions are selected from states, deterministically or stochastically
- Action constraints and feasibility are task dependent and can shape learning dynamics
- Choosing actions balances exploitation of known reward and exploration of uncertain outcomes
