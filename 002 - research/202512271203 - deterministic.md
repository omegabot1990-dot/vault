A system in which **no** randomness is involved in the development of future states. Given a specific starting point and set of rules, it will **always produce the same output**.

## Key Comparison Table

| Feature                    | Deterministic                   | Stochastic                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Output**                 | Single, predictable result      | Range of possible outcomes       |
| **Randomness**             | None                            | Inherent                         |
| **Reproducibility**        | High (same input = same output) | Low (same input = varied output) |
| **Complexity**             | Generally simpler to model      | Highly complex and data-heavy    |
| **Real-world Application** | Ideal for known physical laws   | Better for unpredictable systems |
