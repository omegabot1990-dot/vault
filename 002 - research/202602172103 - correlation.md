- Correlation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">measures the strength and direction of linear association between two variables</mark>
- Pearson correlation is normalised [[202602172058 - covariance|covariance]] and is scale-invariant
- Its value lies in $[-1,1]$
- For random variables $X,Y$ with standard deviations $\sigma_X,\sigma_Y$:

> [!MATH] Pearson Correlation Coefficient
> $$\rho_{X,Y}=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

- Interpretation
	- $\rho=1$ perfect positive linear relation
    - $\rho=-1$ perfect negative linear relation
	- $\rho\approx0$ weak linear relation
- For samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n$:

> [!MATH] Sample Correlation
> $$r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}$$

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Correlation does not imply causation</mark>
- To test if a correlation is statistically significant:

> [!MATH] The t-statistic for $r$
> $$t = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}$$
> 
> - **$r$**: The Pearson correlation coefficient
> - **$n$**: The number of pairs in your sample
> - **$n-2$**: Degrees of freedom ($df$)

- How to Interpret the p-value?
	- $p<0.05$ (Significant)
		- You have enough evidence to say the correlation is not zero
		- The relationship you see is likely "real" and not just a fluke of the sample
	- $p > 0.05$ (Not Significant)
		- You cannot rule out that the correlation happened by random chance
		- Even if $r$ looks high (e.g., 0.6), a small sample size ($x$) might result in a high p-value

> [!MATH] 𝑓(𝑥) From $t$ to $p$
> 1. **The t-score**: Measures how many standard errors your data is away from the "Null" (zero correlation).
>    $$t = \text{Signal} / \text{Noise}$$
> 
> 2. **The p-value**: The area under the "tails" of the distribution curve starting from your $t$-score.
>    $$p = P(|T| > |t|)$$
> 
> - **High $|t|$**: Your data is far from zero $\to$ **Small $p$** (Significant).
> - **Low $|t|$**: Your data is near zero $\to$ **Large $p$** (Not significant).
