- Regression is a [[202602112328 - supervised learning|supervised learning]] task that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">predicts continuous-valued targets</mark>
- The model learns a mapping from inputs to numeric outputs by minimizing a regression loss
- Common examples include price prediction, forecasting, and risk estimation
- Typical losses are mean squared error, mean absolute error, and Huber loss
- Evaluation often uses RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$ depending on scale sensitivity and task goals
- Good regression performance depends on feature quality, noise handling, regularization, and calibration
