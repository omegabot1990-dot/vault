- Regression is a [[202602112328 - supervised learning|supervised learning]] task that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">predicts continuous-valued targets</mark>
- The model learns a mapping from inputs to numeric outputs by minimising a regression [[202602010047 - objective function|loss]]
- Common examples include price prediction, forecasting, and risk estimation
- Typical losses are:
	- Mean Squared Error
	- Mean Absolute Error
	- Huber loss
- [[202602120132 - evaluation|Evaluation]] often uses the following, depending on scale sensitivity and task goals,
	- RMSE
	- MAE
	- $R^2$ 
- Good regression performance depends on feature quality, noise handling, [[202602111636 - regularization|regularization]], and calibration
