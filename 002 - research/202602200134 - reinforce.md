- REINFORCE is a Monte Carlo policy-gradient algorithm for optimizing stochastic policies
- It updates policy parameters using sampled trajectory returns without a learned value model
- The core estimator multiplies log-policy gradients by return, giving an unbiased gradient estimate
- Variance can be high, so baselines are often used to stabilize updates
- REINFORCE is conceptually simple and foundational for modern policy-gradient and actor-critic methods
- It is typically less sample-efficient than bootstrapped actor-critic approaches
