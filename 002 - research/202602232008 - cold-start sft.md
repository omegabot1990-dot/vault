- Cold start SFT is an initial [[202601282201 - supervised fine-tuning|supervised fine-tuning]] stage used before [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|RL]]-style [[202602191644 - post-training|post-training]]
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It seeds the model with high-quality response patterns and stabilises early optimization</mark>
- Training data usually contains curated instruction-response examples, often with reasoning-rich demonstrations
- This stage improves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">readability</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">format consistency</mark>, and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">baseline task competence</mark> before preference optimization
- In multi-stage pipelines, cold start SFT reduces failure modes seen in pure-RL initialisation
- Final quality depends on data curation, coverage, and alignment between SFT targets and later RL objectives
