- In reinforcement learning, reward is the scalar feedback signal returned by the environment after actions
- Rewards define the task objective by indicating desirable and undesirable outcomes
- Agents optimize behavior to maximize expected cumulative return rather than immediate reward only
- Reward design strongly shapes learned behavior and can induce unintended strategies if mis-specified
- Sparse rewards make credit assignment difficult, while dense rewards can speed learning but bias behavior
- Reward signals may be stochastic and delayed, requiring temporal credit assignment methods
