- Reward is the scalar feedback signal returned by the [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] after [[202602192350 - action|actions]]
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Rewards define the task objective by indicating desirable and undesirable outcomes</mark>
- [[202602192343 - agent|Agents]] optimize behaviour to maximise expected cumulative [[202602192355 - return|return]] rather than immediate reward only
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reward design strongly shapes learned behaviour and can induce unintended strategies if mis-specified</mark>
- Sparse rewards make credit assignment difficult, while dense rewards can speed learning but bias behaviour
- Reward signals may be [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochastic]] and delayed, requiring temporal credit assignment methods
