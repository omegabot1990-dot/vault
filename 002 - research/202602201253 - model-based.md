- Model-based [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning]] uses an explicit or learned model of [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] dynamics for planning
- It estimates how [[202602192350 - action|actions]] affect future [[202602192351 - state|states]] and [[202602192352 - reward|rewards]], typically via [[202602200013 - transition|transition]] and reward models
- Planning can be done with lookahead search, dynamic programming, or simulated rollouts
- Model-based methods can be more sample-efficient than [[202602201253 - model-free|model-free]] methods when models are accurate
- Model bias from imperfect dynamics learning can degrade [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] quality and stability
- Hybrid approaches combine model-based planning with model-free [[202602201255 - value-based methods|value]] or [[202602200129 - policy gradient methods|Policy Gradient Methods]] learning
