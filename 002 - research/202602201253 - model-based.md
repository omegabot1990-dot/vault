- Model-based reinforcement learning uses an explicit or learned model of environment dynamics for planning
- It estimates how actions affect future states and rewards, typically via transition and reward models
- Planning can be done with lookahead search, dynamic programming, or simulated rollouts
- Model-based methods can be more sample-efficient than model-free methods when models are accurate
- Model bias from imperfect dynamics learning can degrade policy quality and stability
- Hybrid approaches combine model-based planning with model-free value or policy learning
