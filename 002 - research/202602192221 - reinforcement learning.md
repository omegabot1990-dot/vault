- Reinforcement learning studies how an agent learns actions through interaction to maximize cumulative reward
- The setting is usually modeled as a Markov decision process with states, actions, rewards, and transitions
- A policy maps states to actions, and learning improves this policy from experience
- Core method families are value-based, policy-gradient, and actor-critic approaches
- Exploration-exploitation trade-offs are central because rewards are observed only for chosen actions
- RL is used in control, games, robotics, recommendation, and post-training of language models
