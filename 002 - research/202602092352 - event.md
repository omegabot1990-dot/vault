- An Event is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a specific outcome or a set of outcomes</mark> from a [[202602061354 - random experiment|random experiment]]
- While an _outcome_ is a single result, an _event_ can be one result, multiple results, or even no results at all
- An event is a subset of the Sample Space ($S$), $E \subseteq S$
- Types of Events
	1. Simple Event
		1. Contains only one outcome (e.g., rolling exactly a $3$)
	2. Compound Event
		1. Contains multiple outcomes (e.g., rolling a number $> 4$, which is $\{5, 6\}$)
	3. Impossible Event
		1. A set with no outcomes (e.g., rolling a $7$ on a 6-sided die), $P(E) = 0$
	4. Certain Event
		1. A set containing the entire sample space, $P(E) = 1$
