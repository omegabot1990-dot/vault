- The Mean is the most common measure of "central tendency"
- It is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sum of all values divided by the number of values</mark>

> [!MATH] Mean ($\mu$ or $\bar{x}$)
> The arithmetic average of a dataset:
> $$\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$

- Sensitivity
	- Very sensitive to outliers (one massive number can pull the mean way up)
- Use Case
	- Best for symmetric data without extreme values
