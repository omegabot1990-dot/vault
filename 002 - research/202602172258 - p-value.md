- A p-value is the probability, under the null hypothesis $H_0$, of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained
- It quantifies incompatibility between observed data and $H_0$
- Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against $H_0$, but do not measure effect size
- A p-value is not the probability that $H_0$ is true

> [!MATH] Tail-probability definition
> For test statistic $T$ with observed value $t_{obs}$ under $H_0$:
> $$p=\Pr\big(T\ge t_{obs}\mid H_0\big)$$
> for a right-tailed test

- Two-sided tests use tail probability in both directions from the null expectation
- A significance threshold $\alpha$ (e.g. $0.05$) is used for decision rules, but interpretation should include context and assumptions
