- A p-value is the [[202602062040 - probability|probability]], under the null [[202602172300 - hypothesis|hypothesis]] $H_0$, of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained
- It quantifies the incompatibility between observed data and $H_0$
- Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against $H_0$, but do not measure effect size
- A p-value is not the probability that $H_0$ is true
- For the test statistic $T$ with observed value $t_{obs}$ under $H_0$:

> [!MATH] Tail-Probability Definition
> $$p=\Pr\big(T\ge t_{obs}\mid H_0\big)$$
> - For a right-tailed test

- Two-sided tests use tail probability in both directions from the null expectation
- A significance threshold $\alpha$ (e.g. $0.05$) is used for decision rules, but interpretation should include context and assumptions
