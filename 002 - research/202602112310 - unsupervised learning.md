- Unsupervised learning trains models on unlabeled data to discover latent structure or useful representations
- The objective is not direct label prediction but pattern discovery, compression, density estimation, or generation
- Common task families include clustering, dimensionality reduction, representation learning, and generative modeling
- Typical methods include k-means, PCA, autoencoders, contrastive/self-supervised objectives, and diffusion-based models
- Evaluation is often indirect, using reconstruction quality, likelihood proxies, clustering metrics, or downstream transfer performance
- Unsupervised learning is important when labeled data is scarce but raw data is abundant
