- In reinforcement learning, an agent is the decision-making entity that interacts with an environment over time
- At each step, it observes state information, chooses an action, and receives a reward signal
- The agent aims to maximize expected cumulative return through its policy
- Agent behavior is updated from experience using value estimation, policy optimization, or both
- The quality of an agent depends on representation, exploration strategy, and learning algorithm
- Agent-environment interaction defines the core feedback loop of RL
