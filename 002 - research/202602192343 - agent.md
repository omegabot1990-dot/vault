- An agent is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">decision-making entity</mark> that interacts with an [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] over time
- At each step, it observes [[202602192351 - state|state]] information, chooses an [[202602192350 - action|action]], and receives a [[202602192352 - reward|Reward]] signal
- The agent aims to maximise expected cumulative return through its policy
- Agent behavior is updated from experience using value estimation, policy optimization, or both
- The quality of an agent depends on representation, exploration strategy, and learning algorithm
- Agent-environment interaction defines the core feedback loop of RL
