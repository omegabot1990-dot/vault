- Neural networks are function approximators built from layers of interconnected units
- Each layer applies an affine transformation followed by a nonlinear activation
- Depth enables hierarchical feature learning from simple to complex patterns
- Parameters are learned from data using backpropagation and gradient-based optimization
- Common architectures include multilayer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and transformers
- Model quality depends on architecture, data quality, optimization, and regularization choices
