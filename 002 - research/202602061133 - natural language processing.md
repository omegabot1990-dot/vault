- Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and [[202602061141 - artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]] that uses [[202602061145 - machine learning|machine learning]] to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language (natural language) [^1]
- NLP enables computers and digital devices to recognise, understand and generate text and speech by combining computational linguistics, the rule-based modelling of human language, together with statistical modelling, machine learning and deep learning [^2]
