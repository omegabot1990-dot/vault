- LLM Agent combines LLMs with key modules like [^1]
	- Planning / Reasoning
	- Memory
	- Tool use
- LLM serves as a controller or "brain" that controls the flow of operations [^2]
- User Request - a user question or request
- Agent/Brain - the agent core acting as coordinator [^3]
- Planning - assists the agent in planning future actions [^4]
- Memory - manages the agent's past behaviours [^5]
- Tools - a way to interact with the external environment [^6]
	- Wikipedia Search API, Code Interpreter, and Math Engine
	- Tools could also include databases, knowledge bases, and external models
- Several benchmarks have been designed to evaluate LLM agents [^7]
