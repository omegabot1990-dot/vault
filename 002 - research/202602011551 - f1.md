- Harmonic mean of [[202602011511 - precision|Precision]] and [[202602011513 - recall|Recall]]

> [!MATH] F1
$$F1 = 2 \times\frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$

- Balance 
	- It acts as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">harmonic mean</mark>, ensuring that a high score requires both high precision (few false positives) and high recall (few false negatives)
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Imbalanced Data</mark>
	- It is superior to standard accuracy for scenarios like fraud detection or medical diagnosis, where the positive class is rare
- Range
	- The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">score ranges from 0 to 1</mark>, with 1 being perfect precision and recall, and 0 being the worst
