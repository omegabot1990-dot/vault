- Harmonic mean of [[202602011511 - precision|Precision]] and [[202602011513 - recall|Recall]]
- $F1 = 2 \times\frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$
- **Balance** 
	- It acts as a harmonic mean, ensuring that a high score requires both high precision (few false positives) and high recall (few false negatives)
- **Imbalanced Data** 
	- It is superior to standard accuracy for scenarios like fraud detection or medical diagnosis, where the positive class is rare
- **Range** 
	- The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being perfect precision and recall, and 0 being the worst
