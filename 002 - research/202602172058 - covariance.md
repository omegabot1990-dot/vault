- Covariance measures how two [[202602061340 - random variable|random variables]] vary together around their [[202602062110 - mean|means]]
- Positive covariance means they tend to move in the same direction
- Negative covariance means they tend to move in opposite directions
- Covariance near zero means weak linear co-variation
- For random variables $X,Y$ with means $\mu_X,\mu_Y$:

> [!MATH] Population Covariance
> $$\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=\mathbb{E}\left[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)\right]$$


> [!MATH] Sample Covariance
> For samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n$:
> $$\widehat{\operatorname{Cov}}(X,Y)=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$$

- Covariance has <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">units equal to the product of units</mark> of $X$ and $Y$
- Correlation is a normalised form of covariance
