- A t-test is a [[202602172300 - hypothesis|hypothesis]] test for [[202602062110 - mean|means]] when the [[202602172113 - population|population]] [[202602062206 - variance|variance]] is unknown
- It uses a t-statistic that compares observed mean differences against the estimated standard error
- Common variants are one-sample, two-sample (independent), and paired t-tests
- For the sample mean $\bar{x}$, hypothesised mean $\mu_0$, sample standard deviation $s$, and size $n$:

> [!MATH] One-Sample T-test Statistic
> $$t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

- Under $H_0$ and assumptions, the statistic follows a Student t-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom
- Assumptions include approximate normality (or sufficient sample size) and independence of observations
- The p-value from the t-distribution is used to assess evidence against the null hypothesis
