- A t-test is a hypothesis test for means when population variance is unknown
- It uses a t-statistic that compares observed mean differences against estimated standard error
- Common variants are one-sample, two-sample (independent), and paired t-tests

> [!MATH] One-sample t-test statistic
> For sample mean $\bar{x}$, hypothesized mean $\mu_0$, sample standard deviation $s$, and size $n$:
> $$t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

- Under $H_0$ and assumptions, the statistic follows a Student t-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom
- Assumptions include approximate normality (or sufficient sample size) and independence of observations
- The p-value from the t-distribution is used to assess evidence against the null hypothesis
