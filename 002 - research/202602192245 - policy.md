- In reinforcement learning, a policy specifies how an agent chooses actions from states
- A deterministic policy maps each state to a single action, while a stochastic policy defines an action distribution
- Policies are often parameterized as $\pi_\theta(a\mid s)$ and optimized to maximize expected return
- Value-based methods derive implicit policies, while policy-gradient methods optimize policies directly
- Policy quality is measured by expected cumulative discounted reward under environment dynamics
- Exploration strategy and policy class strongly affect sample efficiency and final performance
