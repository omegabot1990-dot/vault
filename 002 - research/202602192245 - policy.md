- A policy specifies how an [[202602192343 - agent|agent]] chooses [[202602192350 - action|actions]] from [[202602192351 - state|states]]
- A [[202512271203 - deterministic|deterministic]] policy maps each state to a single action, while a [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochastic]] policy defines an action [[202602072325 - distribution|distribution]]
- Policies are often parameterised as below and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">optimized to maximise expected return</mark>

- [[202602201255 - value-based methods|Value-based methods]] derive implicit policies, while [[202602200129 - policy gradient methods|policy-gradient methods]] optimize policies directly
- Policy quality is measured by the expected cumulative discounted [[202602192352 - reward|reward]] under the [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] dynamics
- The exploration strategy and policy class strongly affect sample efficiency and final performance
