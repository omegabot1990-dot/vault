- [ ] What are value-based methods?

---
- In [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning]], <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a policy specifies how an agent chooses actions from states</mark>
- A [[202512271203 - deterministic|deterministic]] policy maps each state to a single action, while a [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochastic]] policy defines an action [[202602072325 - distribution|distribution]]
- Policies are often parameterised as $\pi_\theta(a\mid s)$ and optimized to maximise expected return
- Value-based methods derive implicit policies, while policy-gradient methods optimize policies directly
- Policy quality is measured by the expected cumulative discounted reward under the environment dynamics
- The exploration strategy and policy class strongly affect sample efficiency and final performance
