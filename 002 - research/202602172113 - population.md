- In [[202602062059 - statistics|statistics]], a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">population is the complete set of units or outcomes of interest</mark>
- A sample is a subset drawn from the population for analysis
- Population-level quantities are parameters, such as the [[202602062110 - mean|mean]] $\mu$, [[202602062206 - variance|variance]] $\sigma^2$, and proportion $p$
- Sample-level quantities are statistics, such as the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample variance $s^2$, used to estimate parameters
- Inference aims to use sample information to reason about the population under uncertainty
- For a random variable $X$ representing a population distribution:

> [!MATH] Population Mean and Variance
> $$\mu = \mathbb{E}[X], \qquad \sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}\left[(X-\mu)^2\right]$$

- A clear population definition is essential for valid data collection and evaluation

> [!MATH] 𝑓(𝑥) The Estimator $s^2$
> While the population variance ($\sigma^2$) is the "true" spread, the sample variance ($s^2$) is calculated from your data:
> $$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$
> 
> - **$\bar{x}$**: The sample mean.
> - **$n$**: The number of observations in your sample.
> - **$n - 1$**: This is known as **Bessel's Correction**.
