- In statistics, a population is the complete set of units or outcomes of interest
- A sample is a subset drawn from the population for analysis
- Population-level quantities are parameters, such as mean $\mu$, variance $\sigma^2$, and proportion $p$
- Sample-level quantities are statistics, such as $\bar{x}$ and $s^2$, used to estimate parameters
- Inference aims to use sample information to reason about the population under uncertainty

> [!MATH] Population mean and variance
> For a random variable $X$ representing a population distribution:
> $$\mu = \mathbb{E}[X], \qquad \sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}\left[(X-\mu)^2\right]$$

- Clear population definition is essential for valid data collection and evaluation
