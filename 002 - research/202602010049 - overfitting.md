- Overfitting is when a [[202602010044 - model|model]] performs well on training data but does not generalise to unseen data (test data)
- Overfitting happens when a model memorizes training-specific patterns that do not generalize well to unseen data
- It is characterized by low training error but higher validation or test error
- Common causes include excessive model capacity, weak regularization, and limited or noisy data
- Signs include a widening train-validation gap as training continues
- Typical mitigations are regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and increased data quality or quantity
- Overfitting contrasts with underfitting where both training and validation errors remain high
