- On-policy reinforcement learning updates a policy using data generated by the same policy being improved
- It tightly couples data collection and learning, often requiring fresh rollouts after each update cycle
- Methods like REINFORCE and PPO are typically on-policy in standard use
- On-policy learning is usually more stable but less sample-efficient than off-policy approaches
- Distribution mismatch is reduced because behavior and target policies are aligned during updates
- Practical performance depends on rollout horizon, variance reduction, and update constraints
