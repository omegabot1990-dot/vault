- On-policy reinforcement learning updates a [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] using data generated by the same policy being improved
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It tightly couples data collection and learning</mark>, often requiring fresh rollouts after each update cycle
- Methods like [[202602200134 - reinforce|REINFORCE]] and [[202602201241 - proximal policy optimization|PPO]] are typically on-policy in standard use
- On-policy learning is usually more stable but <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">less sample-efficient</mark> than [[202602201246 - off-policy|off-policy]] approaches
- [[202602072325 - distribution|Distribution]] mismatch is reduced because behaviour and target policies are aligned during updates
- Practical performance depends on rollout horizon, [[202602062206 - variance|variance]] reduction, and update constraints
