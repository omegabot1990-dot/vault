A system that incorporates randomness or uncertainty. Even with identical initial conditions, the system can produce **different results** each time it is run.

## Key Comparison Table

|Feature|Deterministic|Stochastic|
|---|---|---|
|**Output**|Single, predictable result|Range of possible outcomes|
|**Randomness**|None|Inherent|
|**Reproducibility**|High (same input = same output)|Low (same input = varied output)|
|**Complexity**|Generally simpler to model|Highly complex and data-heavy|
|**Real-world Application**|Ideal for known physical laws|Better for unpredictable systems|
