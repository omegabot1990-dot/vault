- We estimate the [[202602080132 - conditional probability|conditional probability]] of a label given input features
- For a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Data Point</mark> (Example or Sample), there is a set of attributes we call <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Features</mark> (Covariates), and our objective is to predict another feature, called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Label</mark> (Target), that is not part of the input space
