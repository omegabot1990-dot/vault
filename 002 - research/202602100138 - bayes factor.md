- The Bayes Factor (BF) is a ratio that measures the "strength of evidence" provided by the data for one hypothesis versus another [^1]
- It tells you how much the data has changed the relative odds between two competing models (usually the Null Hypothesis $H_{0}$ and the Alternative $H_{1}$)
- The Bayes Factor for Model 1 over Model 0 is the ratio of the [[202602062040 - probability|probabilities]] of the observed data ($D$) under each model:

> [!MATH] Bayes Factor ($BF_{10}$)
> $$BF_{10} = \frac{P(D | H_1)}{P(D | H_0)}$$
> 
> - **$BF_{10} > 1$**: Evidence supports the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)
> - **$BF_{10} = 1$**: The data is equally likely under both; no evidence either way
> - **$BF_{10} < 1$**: Evidence supports the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
