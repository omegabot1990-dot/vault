- The sigmoid function maps a real number to the interval $(0,1)$
- It is smooth, monotone increasing, and often used as a squashing nonlinearity

> [!MATH] Sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$
> The sigmoid (logistic) function is
> $$\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

- Limits
  - $\sigma(x)\to1$ as $x\to\infty$
  - $\sigma(x)\to0$ as $x\to-\infty$

> [!MATH] Derivative of sigmoid
> The derivative can be written in terms of itself
> $$\sigma'(x)=\sigma(x)\left(1-\sigma(x)\right)$$

- The largest slope is at $x=0$, where $\sigma(0)=\tfrac12$
