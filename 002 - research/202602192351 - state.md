- In reinforcement learning, a state is the information representation used to choose actions at a time step
- State should contain enough information to support the Markov property for decision making
- In fully observable settings, state can coincide with the true environment configuration
- In partially observable settings, agents use observations or belief/state estimators as proxies
- State design strongly affects sample efficiency, stability, and final policy quality
- State transitions are governed by environment dynamics conditioned on actions
