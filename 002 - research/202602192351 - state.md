- A state is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information representation</mark> used to choose [[202602192350 - action|actions]] at a time step
- The state should contain enough information to support the [[202602192236 - markov decision process|Markov]] property for decision-making
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">In fully observable settings, the state can coincide with the true environment configuration</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In partially observable settings, agents use observations or belief/state estimators as proxies</mark>
- State design strongly affects sample efficiency, stability, and final [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] quality
- State transitions are governed by [[202602192345 - environment|environment]] dynamics conditioned on actions
