- Classification is a supervised learning task where inputs are mapped to discrete class labels
- The model outputs class scores or probabilities, and prediction selects the most likely class
- Common settings are binary classification, multiclass classification, and multilabel classification
- Typical training uses cross-entropy-based losses with sigmoid or softmax output layers
- Performance is evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC depending on class balance and task goals
- Good classification performance depends on data quality, calibration, regularization, and decision-threshold selection
