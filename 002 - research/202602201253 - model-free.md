- Model-free [[202602192221 - reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning]] learns behaviour directly from experience without an explicit dynamics model
- It avoids learning $P(s'\mid s,a)$ and instead estimates value functions, policies, or both
- Classical model-free methods include Q-learning, SARSA, REINFORCE, and PPO-style actor-critic variants
- It is often simpler to deploy but may require more environment interactions than model-based methods
- Experience replay, target networks, and advantage estimation are common stabilizing techniques
- Model-free methods are widely used when accurate environment models are unavailable
