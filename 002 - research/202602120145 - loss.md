- A loss function maps model predictions and targets to a scalar error signal
- Training minimizes expected loss to fit parameters to data
- Different tasks use different losses, such as cross-entropy for classification and MSE/MAE for regression
- Lower loss usually indicates better fit on the measured dataset, but not always better generalization
- Validation loss is commonly used for model selection and early stopping
- Loss design affects optimization behavior, gradient scale, and robustness to outliers
