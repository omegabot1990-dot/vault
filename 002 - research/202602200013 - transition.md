- A transition is one interaction step from $(s_t,a_t)$ to $(s_{t+1},r_{t+1})$
- Transition dynamics describe how [[202602192350 - action|actions]] change [[202602192351 - state|states]], often represented by:

> [!MATH] Transition
> $$P(s'\mid s,a)$$

- Learning algorithms use transitions as core [[202602111335 - training|training]] data for value and [[202602192245 - policy|policy]] updates
- In [[202602201253 - model-free|model-free]] RL, transitions are sampled directly from experience
- In [[202602201253 - model-based|model-based]] RL, a learned transition model predicts future states for planning
- Transition [[202512271205 - stochastic|stochasticity]] and delayed effects increase credit-assignment difficulty
