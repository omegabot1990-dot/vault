- In reinforcement learning, a transition is one interaction step from $(s_t,a_t)$ to $(s_{t+1},r_{t+1})$
- Transition dynamics describe how actions change states, often represented by $P(s'\mid s,a)$
- Learning algorithms use transitions as core training data for value and policy updates
- In model-free RL, transitions are sampled directly from experience
- In model-based RL, a learned transition model predicts future states for planning
- Transition stochasticity and delayed effects increase credit-assignment difficulty
