- For a discrete [[202602061340 - random variable|random variable]] $X$, the expectation is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">sum of every possible value multiplied by its probability</mark> [^1][^2]
- For a variable with specific outcomes $x_i$ and [[202602062040 - probability|probabilities]] $P(x_i)$:

> [!MATH] Expected Value $E[X]$
> $$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i P(X=x_i)$$
> 
> - **$x_i$**: The possible outcome (e.g., heads or tails in a coin toss)
> - **$P(x_i)$**: How likely that outcome is (e.g., 50%)

- For a variable with a [[202602091301 - probability density function|density function]] $f(x)$:

> [!MATH] Expected Value $E[X]$
> $$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx$$

- Intuition
	- It is the "weighted sum" where each outcome is weighted by how likely it is to happen
