- Statistics is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">science of learning from data</mark>
- While [[202602062040 - probability|probability]] predicts future outcomes from a known model, statistics works backwards to discover the model or "truth" from existing data
	- Starting off with the collection and organisation of data, and working back to what inferences we might draw about the process that generated the data [^1]

> [!MATH] Direction of Inference
> - **Probability**: $\text{Model} \to \text{Data}$ 
>   *If I have a fair die, how often will I roll a 6?*
> - **Statistics**: $\text{Data} \to \text{Model}$ 
>   *I rolled a 6 ten times in a row; is this die actually fair?*

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Descriptive Statistics</mark>
	- Summarising what you have (e.g., [[202602062110 - mean|Mean]], [[202602062113 - median|Median]], [[202602062115 - mode|Mode]], [[202602062206 - variance|Variance]], [[202602062209 - standard deviation|Standard Deviation]])
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Central tendency</mark> identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution to provide a summary of the data's "middle"
		- [[202602062110 - mean|Mean]]
		- [[202602062113 - median|Median]]
		- [[202602062115 - mode|Mode]]
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Inferential Statistics</mark>
	- Making "educated guesses" about a large group (Population) based on a small piece of it (Sample)
- Statistics are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">empirical quantities</mark> that are computed as functions of the observed data [^2]
