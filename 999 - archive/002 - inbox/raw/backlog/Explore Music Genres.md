# House

<aside> 💡 House music is one of the original forms of modern dance music that has a 4/4 beat. Considered to be the descendant of disco music, house music has incorporated a variety of different traditional dance music such as funk, soul, afro-latin beats and much more. Today house music still maintains its original style and characteristics but has also evolved into a variety of sub genres that have incorporated different energies, instruments, and styles. _[3]_

</aside>

- Wiki _[2]_
    
    House music, a genre of electronic dance music, is defined by its repetitive 4/4 rhythms, typically at a tempo of 120 to 130 BPM. Key elements include bass drums on all four beats, off-beat hi-hats, snare drums, claps, or snaps on the second and fourth beats, synthesizer riffs, and deep basslines. Vocals, if present, may be sung, spoken, or sampled. The genre often employs electronic drum machines, particularly models like the Roland TR-808, TR-909, or TR-707, to create its distinctive drum beats. Additional percussion such as claps, shakers, snare drums, or hi-hats is used to add syncopation. Early Chicago house music frequently featured a rhythm riff based on the clave pattern. African or Latin influences can be added through congas, bongos, or metallic percussion. In house music production, drum sounds may be "saturated" for a more aggressive edge. A subgenre, acid house, is particularly known for the squelchy sounds of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. House music's accessibility is partly due to its production on "cheap and consumer-friendly electronic equipment," previously dismissed by traditional musicians. Producers typically rely on sampled instruments instead of live session musicians, focusing on layering drum machine beats, samples, synth basslines, and other elements. Despite this layering, the texture of house music is relatively sparse, emphasizing the lower-pitched bass register over higher-pitched melodies typical of pop songs.

# Techno

<aside> 💡 Techno’s BPM can range from 120 to even 140+, making techno even more difficult to classify. However, most can agree techno is one of the oldest genres of electronic dance music.

It’s characterized by:

- The use of a 4/4 synthesized kick drum (the “un” in the “untz”)
- Repetitive beats and loops using various percussions
- Heavy use of synthesizers

Typically, techno is associated with a darker feel and sonic elements compared to other genres. However, that’s not always the case. Compared to other genres of dance music, techno has a higher focus on percussive elements and is known for creating moments of tension and release. _[10]_

</aside>

- Wiki _[11]_
    
    Techno, a genre of electronic dance music (EDM), is typically produced for continuous DJ sets with tempos ranging from 120 to 150 beats per minute. It commonly features a 4/4 time signature with a repetitive "four on the floor" beat. Artists in this genre frequently use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s, like the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, are highly valued, with software emulations of these retro instruments being popular.
    
    In techno music, the emphasis is primarily on rhythm rather than other musical aspects. The progression of techno tracks often revolves around the manipulation of the timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets. Unlike other EDM forms that are typically produced using synthesizer keyboards and adhere to Western harmonic structures, techno does not always strictly follow these harmonic practices. Instead, it often prioritizes timbral manipulation. A key distinguishing feature of techno music and its aesthetic is the creative embrace of music production technology.

# Nu Disco

<aside> 💡 Nu disco is an electronic take on disco music that made waves in the indie dance scene of the 2000s and 2010s. It draws heavily from the house music of the 1980s and 1990s and the classic disco tracks of the 1970s. In the spirit of EDM and related forms of electronica, it also incorporates twenty-first-century sampling and synth technology.

Stylistically, nu disco shares many characteristics with French house music, which is also known as disco house. Yet, while French house leans heavily on synthesizers, samplers, and a steady, unchanging groove, nu disco adds in elements from the live disco music of the 1970s.

</aside>

### **Characteristics of Nu Disco**

- **Tempo and Rhythm:** Similar to classic disco, Nu Disco typically features a steady four-to-the-floor beat, with tempos usually ranging from 110 to 125 beats per minute.
- **Instrumentation:** Nu Disco often utilizes traditional disco elements like string sections, horns, electric piano, and funk basslines, combined with modern synthesizers and electronic effects.
- **Production Style:** While retaining the analog warmth of classic disco, Nu Disco incorporates contemporary production techniques, including digital recording and mixing.
- **Vocals:** Vocals in Nu Disco can range from full lyrical songs, reminiscent of traditional disco, to minimalistic and more electronically altered vocals.
- **Aesthetic:** Nu Disco often embraces a retro-futuristic aesthetic, drawing on 1970s and 1980s visual styles while integrating modern electronic music culture.
- **Core funk grooves:** Many nu disco tracks sample core drum grooves from 1970s funk, soul, and disco.
- **Modern synths:** Similar to the more synthetic forms of EDM and electronica, nu disco uses contemporary synth technology.
- **Selected live instrumentation:** In a nod to the original disco movement, nu disco often features bass lines and guitar licks played by live musicians.
- **Long, repetitive grooves:** Nu disco embraces the long run times of 1970s and 1980s disco, but it concerns itself less with the structured sections and pop hooks of those earlier genres.
