- Affective Modelling
	- Affective modelling is the process of creating models that incorporate human emotions to understand or predict behaviour. 
	- This field applies to various areas, including computer science, education, and marketing, where emotions are used to make systems more human-like or to create more effective products and learning experiences. 
	- It can involve computational models that predict emotions based on behaviour or physiological data, or models that use emotions to guide design and decision-making.

	- Sentiment Analysis
		- Sentiment analysis is one of the foundational AI capabilities in mental health apps — it interprets **the emotional tone of user text** in messages, chats, or journal entries.
	- Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
		- While text captures _what_ users say, speech reveals _how_ they feel.  
		- SER extracts **paralinguistic features** — such as tone, pitch, energy, and pauses — to infer affective states, even when words are neutral.
