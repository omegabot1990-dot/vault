## Axioms
1. Time = Money 
   The only real currency worthwhile, at its root, is **time**.
2. Given,
   *f* is a function
   t is time, in a 24hr day
   Ideally, ==*f*(t) -> 24hr== is what we desire to achieve, in other words, *to be happy all the time*.
3. Cost function, *g*(t) = time takes to learn a skill.
   The greater the *g*(t), the more economically valuable the skill becomes, or is perceived as so in most practical matters.
   
## Vision
Minimise the time to learn a new skill, i.e. *g*(t) -> 0hr. 
Doing so removes the economic incentive and thus heralds freedom of the highest order.

Once society (subset of the world) is freed from the shackles of the ***system***, we will have achieved Universal (subset) Basic Income (personal definition).

This society will have no [[202407081413 - maslow's hierarchy of needs#Deficiency Needs|deficiency needs]].
