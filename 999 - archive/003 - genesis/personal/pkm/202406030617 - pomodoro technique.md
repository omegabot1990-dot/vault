## Core Concepts

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that helps improve focus, attention, and productivity. It involves working in focused 25-minute increments (called "pomodoros") separated by 5-minute breaks.

To use this technique:

1. Choose a task to work on.
2. Start a pomodoro timer for 25 minutes.
3. Focus only on the chosen task; avoid emails, social media, and other distractions.
4. Take a 5-minute break when the timer goes off.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 four times, then take a longer 15-minute break.

The benefits of this technique include:

* Improved focus and attention
* Prevention of burnout
* Increased awareness of time
* Reduced distractions
