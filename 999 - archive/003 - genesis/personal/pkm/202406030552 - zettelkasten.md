## Core Concepts

1. **Atomicity**: A crucial aspect of note-taking in this framework. Each individual note should contain only one distinct idea or concept, summarised in your own words. This ensures that each note remains focused and easy to understand, making it simpler to build upon previous notes and connect them to related ideas.

2. **Connectivity**: Vital for creating a meaningful network of notes. Each note needs to be linked to other relevant notes, allowing you to establish relationships between different concepts and ideas. This enables you to see the bigger picture, identify patterns and connections, and make new insights by combining seemingly disparate pieces of information.

3. **Incrementality**: Each note builds upon previous notes, allowing for a deeper exploration of topics and the development of more nuanced understanding. This incremental process enables you to refine your ideas, challenge your assumptions, and continually improve your knowledge management system.
