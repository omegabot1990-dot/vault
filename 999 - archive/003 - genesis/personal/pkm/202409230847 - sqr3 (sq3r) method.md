The **SQR3 Method** (also spelt SQ3R) is a systematic approach to reading and comprehending the material, particularly useful for academic or research purposes. It stands for **Survey**, **Question**, **Read**, **Recite**, and **Review**. This method promotes active reading and helps improve understanding, retention, and recall of information by breaking down the process into manageable steps.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Survey** (Skim or Preview)

The first step is to **survey** the material before reading it in detail. This involves quickly scanning or skimming the text to get an overview of its structure, content, and main ideas.

#### How to Survey:

- **Look at headings and subheadings**: This will give you a sense of the organisation and key topics.
- **Read the introduction and conclusion**: These sections often summarise the main points.
- **Examine any visual elements**: Charts, graphs, images, or tables can provide important information.
- **Skim each paragraph's first and last sentences**: This can give you a snapshot of the key points.
- **Check the summary**: If the text has a summary section (e.g., at the end of a chapter or article), read it for an overview.
- **Note any bolded or italicised text**: This highlights key terms or concepts.

#### Why It’s Important:

Surveying helps you prepare mentally for the material, providing context and helping you identify the most important sections before diving into a detailed read. It primes your brain by giving you a broad framework of what to expect.

### 2. **Question**

After surveying, the next step is to formulate **questions** based on the material you are about to read. Turning headings and topics into questions engages you with the text and gives you a specific purpose for reading.

#### How to Create Questions:

- **Turn headings into questions**: For example, if a section is titled "The Causes of Climate Change," ask, "What are the causes of climate change?"
- **Ask yourself what you want to learn**: Based on the introduction or survey, what information are you hoping to gain?
- **Use the 5 W's and H**: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. These questions help you probe deeper into the material.

#### Why It’s Important:

Questioning transforms passive reading into **active reading**. Instead of simply absorbing information, you're actively looking for answers, which boosts focus and comprehension and makes the material more engaging and memorable.

### 3. **Read**

Now, read the material carefully, with the goal of answering the questions you created in the previous step.

#### How to Read Effectively:

- **Read actively**: Don’t just passively move through the text. Remember your formulated questions, and look for answers as you read.
- **Take notes**: Write down key points, concepts, and any answers to your questions.
- **Highlight or underline important parts**: Mark, particularly important sections or provide critical information.
- **Pause occasionally**: Reflect on whether you understand what you’ve read so far, and if not, reread the challenging section.
- **Focus on key ideas**: Avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details. Focus on understanding the main concepts.

#### Why It’s Important:

Reading with specific questions in mind helps you stay focused and extract relevant information. This step is where you dig deeper into the text to comprehend the material fully.

### 4. **Recite**

After reading, the next step is to **recite** or **summarise** what you’ve learned in your own words. This forces you to process the information more deeply and ensure you understand it.

#### How to Recite:

- **Summarise the key points**: Summarise the main ideas aloud or in written form without looking at your notes or the text.
- **Answer your questions**: Go back to the questions you created earlier and try to answer them from memory.
- **Teach the material**: Pretend you’re explaining the content to someone else. This helps reinforce your understanding.
- **Use flashcards**: If studying specific facts or terms, create flashcards and test your recall.

#### Why It’s Important:

Reciting the information helps transfer it from **short-term memory** to **long-term memory**. By explaining concepts in your own words, you ensure a deeper understanding of the material and identify any gaps in your knowledge.

### 5. **Review**

The final step is to **review** the material regularly. This involves revisiting your notes, questions, and summaries to reinforce the material and improve retention over time.

#### How to Review:

- **Review your notes**: Re-read your summaries, answers, and key points regularly, especially before an exam or presentation.
- **Test yourself**: Try to recall key points without looking at your notes. Answer the questions again.
- **Space out your reviews**: Use the spaced repetition technique, which involves reviewing material at increasing intervals (e.g., one day later, one week later, then a month later).
- **Focus on areas of weakness**: Review sections that were difficult to understand or remember.
- **Use active recall**: Test yourself actively by asking questions about the material instead of just re-reading it.

#### Why It’s Important:

Reviewing is critical for long-term retention. Without review, most people forget most of their lessons within days or weeks. Regular review helps consolidate the material in your memory.


## Benefits of the SQR3 Method:

1. **Improves comprehension**: Engaging with the material through questions and recitation helps you understand it more deeply.
2. **Enhances memory retention**: The steps of recitation and review reinforce what you’ve learned, making it easier to recall the information later.
3. **Encourages active learning**: This method helps you become an active participant in the learning process rather than a passive reader.
4. **Increases focus and organisation**: The structure of the SQR3 method gives you a clear plan for reading and studying, reducing distractions and improving efficiency.
5. **Helps with exam preparation**: Since you review and test yourself regularly, this method is excellent for preparing for exams and writing papers based on research material.
