## Core Concepts

The fundamental concept is to transfer the responsibility of storing and organising knowledge from your brain to an external system, thereby liberating mental resources for creative and strategic tasks. This external system should serve as a complementary tool that enhances your ability to execute tasks and projects, making it easier to access and utilise the information you've captured.

* **Capture**: It is essential to record everything in the system, without exception, to ensure that all relevant information is accounted for.

* **Organise**: The system should be designed to make it easy to find specific pieces of information, allowing you to quickly locate and retrieve the knowledge you need.

* **Distill**: Once captured, the information must be reviewed, condensed, and transformed into a useful form. This may involve highlighting key points, summarising concepts, creating visual diagrams, or engaging in other activities that help you understand and remember the information more effectively.
  
* **Engage**: To truly leverage the power of this system, it is essential to actively interact with the information, transforming it in a way that aligns with your thinking and enhances your ability to execute tasks and projects.
  
* **Express**: Finally, the knowledge gained through this process should be shared with others through blogging, project development, or other means, allowing you to express yourself and share your insights with the world.
