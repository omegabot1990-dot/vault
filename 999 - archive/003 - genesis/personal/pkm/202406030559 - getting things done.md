## Core Concepts

1. **Capture**: Collect everything that has your attention into a trusted system, such as an inbox or notebook. This includes tasks, ideas, projects, things that need to be organised, or action items.

By capturing everything in one place, you'll reduce stress and get a clear view of what needs to be done.

2. **Clarify**: Process each item to determine if it's actionable. If so:
	* Do it immediately if the task can be completed in under 2 minutes.
	* Defer or delegate the task if it cannot be done immediately, considering options such as scheduling a reminder, assigning the task to someone else, or putting it off until later.

If an item is not actionable, decide whether to:
- Discard it
- File it for reference
- Add it to your list for later review

3. **Organise**: Put everything where it belongs by creating lists and categories for projects, next actions, and waiting for. Use reminders, calendars, and lists to keep track of deadlines and next steps.

This step helps you maintain a clear and organised system that is easy to use and reference.

4. **Reflect**: Regularly review your system to:
	* Refresh your memory on what needs to be done
	* Prioritise tasks based on importance and urgency
	* Ensure your system remains up-to-date and ready for the next week

Regular reflection helps you stay focused, motivated, and in control of your goals.

5. **Engage**: Simply follow your system to choose what to do next. By doing so, you'll be able to make progress on your tasks and projects without feeling overwhelmed or stuck.
