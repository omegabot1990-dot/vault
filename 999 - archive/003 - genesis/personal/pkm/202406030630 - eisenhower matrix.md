## Core Concepts

The Eisenhower Matrix is founded upon three fundamental principles:

1. **Urgent Tasks:** These are tasks that require immediate attention, often due to time-sensitive deadlines or critical circumstances.
   
2. **Important Tasks:** These are tasks that contribute significantly to long-term goals and missions, even if they do not have an immediate deadline.

The matrix then divides these two categories into four distinct quadrants:

* **Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important (Do)** - Tasks that are both urgent and important should be addressed immediately. These tasks typically require prompt attention and cannot be delegated or deferred.
  
* **Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important (Plan)** - Tasks that are important but not urgent should be planned and scheduled accordingly. These tasks contribute to long-term goals and missions, but do not have a pressing deadline.
  
* **Quadrant 3: Urgent but not Important (Delegate/Defer)** - Tasks that are urgent but not important can often be delegated or deferred. These tasks may require immediate attention, but their impact is minimal or insignificant.
  
* **Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and not Important (Eliminate)** - Tasks that are neither urgent nor important should be eliminated or minimised. These tasks do not contribute to long-term goals and missions, and can often be avoided altogether.

By applying the Eisenhower Matrix, individuals can gain a clearer understanding of their priorities and make more informed decisions about how to allocate their time and resources.
