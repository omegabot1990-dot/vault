## Scale

- Major Scale

## Chord Progression

- I I V I
- F F C F

## Remarks

- If you look at the melody, you can see that the notes that appear most often are notes that are in the accompanying chords. 
- For example, the Fs and As are both part of the F major triad in the first bar — these notes are _chord tones_. 
- The Gs are _non-chord tones_, but they sound like they're simply "connecting" F and A. Non-chord tones that are between two adjacent chord tones are called _passing tones_.
- There's another principle at work here; these chords are built on the first and fifth notes of the scale (F and C). You can call these chords the _1_ and _5_ chords, respectively. Chord progressions that alternate between 1 and 5 create a strong sense of departure and arrival, tension and release. Compare the "stable" and "grounded" sounds of the 1-chord passages with the "tense" and "unfinished" sounds of the 5-chord passages.
