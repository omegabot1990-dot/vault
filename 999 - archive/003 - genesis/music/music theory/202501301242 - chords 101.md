## Chords

A chord is a group of multiple pitches that play at the same time.

#### Major Triad

The most common chords are _triads_, which are built by adding the third and fifth notes in the scale above a starting note (or _root_). For example, in C major, the triad built on C contains:

- C (the root)
- E (the third note above C; often called just "the third")
- G (the fifth note above C; often called just "the fifth")

> As with major scales, most people hear major triads as "happy" or "uplifting."

###### Major Chord

- 1 - 3 - 5, triad
- Example: CMaj, C
- 2W / WH
	- Example: CMaj - C E G, *CE - 2W* and *EG - WH*

#### Minor Triad

In C minor, the triad on C is built the same way:

- C (the root)
- E♭ (the third note above C; often called just "the third")
- G (the fifth note above C; often called just "the fifth")

> As with minor scales, most people hear minor triads as "sad" or "dark."

###### Minor Chord

- 1 - ♭3 - 5, triad
- Example: Amin, Am
- WH / 2W
	- Example: Amin - A C E, *AC - WH* and *CE - 2W*

# Get Up, Stand Up - Bob Marley & The Wailers

Several instruments are playing chords in this song, including electric guitars and acoustic and electric pianos.

However, these instruments are used in very different ways. Some guitars and keyboards play chords in regular, repeating rhythms, while others play more improvisatory, less predictable patterns.

- Underlying the entire song is a single repeated C minor chord.
