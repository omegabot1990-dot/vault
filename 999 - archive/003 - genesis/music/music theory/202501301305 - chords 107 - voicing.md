## Voicing

Voicing is the order in which notes are stacked in the chord

## Chord Inversions

Chord Inversion is when the root note is not the lowest note
Full Chord Inversion - Root note is the highest note
Represented as ==Slash Chords==, eg: C/E, means Cmaj with E as bass note

- First Inversion
	- 3 - 5 - 1, ♭3 - 5 - 1, 
- Second Inversion
	- 5 - 1 - 3, 5 - 1 - ♭3

## Borrowed Chords [^1]

Chords taken from key which has the same tonic root
Common chords borrowed are the following
- IV <-> iv *(usually min7)*
	- I - V - IV <-> I - V - iv
	- I - V - IV - iv
- vi <-> ♭VI *(usually maj7)*
	- I - V - IV - ♭VI
	- I - vi - ♭VI - V
- iii <-> ♭III *(usually maj7)*
	- I - iii - ♭III - ii
	- I - vi - ♭III - V
- ii <-> ii° *(usually played as m7♭5)*
	- ii° - V - I
- vii° <-> ♭VII *(usually played as dom7)*
	- I - ♭VI - ♭VII
	- I - iii - IV - ♭VII
	- I - V - iv - ♭VII

Example, CMaj and Cmin are parallel keys with same tonic root
CMaj
- I - ii - iii- IV - V - vi - vii°
- C - Dm - Em - F - G - Am - B°
Cmin
- i - ii° - ♭III - iv - v - ♭VI - ♭VII
- Cm - D° - E♭ - Fm - Gm - A♭ - B♭

*I - V - IV* progression can be replaced by *I - V - iv*, where we use CMaj Scale for *I - V* and Cmin Scale for *iv*
