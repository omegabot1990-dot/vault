## Pitches

Common pitches are,
- C
- A
- G
- E
- D

## Keys and Scales

- Most music is in a particular _key_. If we say that a song is "in the key of C," this means that the pitch C sounds like the most stable “home note” (or _tonic_) for the song.
- Likewise, most songs use notes within a particular _scale_—a collection of notes arranged from low to high.
- ==Each type of scale has a distinct sound, and many people have particular emotional associations with particular scales.==
- You can build scales by adding more notes at specific distances (or _intervals_ ([[202501301122 - intervals 101]])) above the tonic. 
- The two most common types (or _qualities_) of scales are *major* and _minor_.
	- Most people tend to hear major scales as "happy" or "bright".
	- Most people tend to hear minor scales as "sad" or "dark".
- The chromatic scale has no notion of a central tonic.

#### Common Scales

- C major
	- C D E F G A B
- A minor
	- A B C D E F G
- Chromatic Scale
	- When working with all 12 notes, you might have found it easy to make patterns that sound unusual or "wrong". 
	- Most music uses only smaller subsets of these 12 notes (such as the seven notes of the major or minor scales), and we're used to hearing music with this smaller number of pitches.
