## Beat

- People commonly use the word "beat" to mean "a pattern (or _rhythm_) played by drums". The thing you're making when you create and play patterns in these lessons is "a beat".
- But, confusingly, there's another use of the word "beat," which means "a regular, repeating pulse that underlies a musical pattern." In this context, people tap their feet along with "the beat."

## Tempo

- The speed at which your patterns playback is called the _tempo_. Tempo is measured in _beats per minute_ (BPM). 
- So, if we say a piece of music is "at 120 BPM," we mean that there are 120 beats (pulses) every minute.
- Some musical patterns have a very clear underlying beat, while others have a more subtle or implied one. Add notes on the Kick line at positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 to hear a steady beat.

## Bars

- This grouping of four beats is called a _bar_ or _measure_.
- Songs are made by combining multiple bars of music to form larger sections and then combining these larger sections.

## Tempo and Genre

- Dub: 60-90 bpm
- Hip-hop: 60-100 bpm
- House: 115-130 bpm
- Techno/trance: 120-140 bpm
- Dubstep: 135-145 bpm
- Drum and bass: 160-180 bpm

## Backbeat 

==Many styles of music that are "in four" feature a clap or snare on the second and fourth beat, a pattern known as a _backbeat_.==

## Basics

1. Drums
2. Bass
3. Chords
4. Melodies

## Drums

1. Open Hat
	1. If you play a closed hi-hat while an open hi-hat sound is still being heard, the closed sound will "win" and stop the open sound immediately. This matches how hi-hats behave in the real world; the hi-hats can't be opened and closed simultaneously.
2. Closed Hat
3. Clap
4. Snare
5. Kick
