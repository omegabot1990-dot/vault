## Chord Progression

- Combining (or _harmonising_) the melody with some chords helps to fill out the texture.
- A series of chords played in a particular order. 
- In many types of music, chord progressions create a sense of tension and release by moving away from the tonic of the song and then back again.

> Example: [[202501292224 - mary had a little lamp|mary had a little lamb]]
