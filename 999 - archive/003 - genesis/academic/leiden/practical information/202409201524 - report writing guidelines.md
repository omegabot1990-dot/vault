#### Guidelines for Writing Reports

When writing your report, keep in mind the following points:

1. Your report should be self-contained. The reader should be able to understand the whole story without looking into your code, reading instructions, or checking other papers.

2. Your report should be well structured. For each task, explain what you were supposed to do, what you did, what the results are and, most importantly, draw some conclusions.

3. Your report should be detailed. When explaining your experiments, specify the setup (values of parameters you used, algorithms, options, etc.) so the reader can understand what you did without checking your code. Your report should contain observations and conclusions you’ve made while working on the assignment. If you see something strange in your results, write something about it! Most importantly, explain possible reasons for the strange things you've observed!

4. Your report should be technically correct. It should be neatly formatted and spellchecked, and tables and figures should contain informative captions.


#### Review Criteria

When evaluating the reports, we will take into account the following criteria,
1. **Clarity and Readability**
   Can you easily follow the story and understand what the authors wanted to communicate?
2. **Completeness**
   Are all tasks listed in the assignment fully addressed?
3. **Validity** 
   Do you believe that the results are valid? Are they consistent with your expectations?
4. **Reflection** 
   Are the observations and conclusions made in the paper supported adequately by experiments? Are some interesting, unexpected insights presented?
   Have you learned something new from reading the report? 
5. **Technical Correctness** 
   The report is neatly formatted and spell-checked, and tables and figures contain informative captions, etc.
   
#### Contributions of Group Members

To encourage an even distribution of workload throughout the assignments between group members, we would like you to include a short section on individual contributions in each of your reports. This should look something like:

_Contributions:_  
_Bob: Task 1 code, task 1 report, task 2 code_  
_Jane: Task 2 code, task 3 code_  
_John: Task 2 report, task 3 code, task 3 report_

In the vast majority of cases, this will not influence your grades in any way. This measure is mostly for handling the very rare cases where some group members refuse to contribute completely. In these cases, these statements might be used as proof to adjust the grades (assuming the claims are valid).
