1. Sociotechnical Systems Mind Map

---
[^1]: It’s a rather complex and lengthy text that introduces you to high-level thinking about sociotechnical systems and the value-laden nature of technology.
[^2]: An example to illustrate how the sociotechnical system concept can be applied to analyse concrete situations and instances of AI technology. What are the main takeaways from this research? In what ways does this connect and differ from the approach laid down by Pfaffenberger?
