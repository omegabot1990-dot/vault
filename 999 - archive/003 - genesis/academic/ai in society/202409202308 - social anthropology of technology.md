## Cues

1. What is **material culture**?
   Material culture refers to physical objects, artefacts, tools, and spaces that people create and use in their daily lives and that are imbued with cultural significance. It includes all the tangible items that a society produces and consumes. 
   These objects often reflect the *values*, *beliefs*, *practices*, and *social structures* of those who make and use them. It provides insights into how ==people interact with their environment==, ==express their identity==, and ==transmit cultural meanings==.
   
   > The material manifestation of the various ways men and women throughout time have chosen to define and pursue existence. Seen in this light, the history of technology is part of the much broader history of human aspirations, and the plethora of made things is a product of human minds replete with fantasies, longings, wants, and desires. - Basalla
2. What is a **sociotechnical system**?
   A sociotechnical system is one of the chief means by which humans produce their social world, engendering a certain solidarity that is neither economic nor political. Sociotechnical systems are *heterogeneous con­structs* that stem from successfully modifying social and nonsocial actors so that they work together harmoniously.
   A sociotechnical system is much better described as an *activity system*, a domain of purposive, goal-oriented action in which knowledge and behaviour are reciprocally constituted by social, individual, and material phe­nomena, i.e. technological activ­ity that stems from the linkage of techniques and material culture to the social coordination of labour. Viewed as an activity system, a sociotechnical system must include all the conceptual, vis­ual, experiential, tactile, and intuitive knowledge necessary to modify these diverse elements to work together harmoniously.
   **Key features**:
   * A sociotechnical system refuses to deny the *sociality* of human technological activity.
   * Sociotechnical system development does not imply that it is the logical system or the only possible system that could have developed under the circumstances; social choice, tactics, alternative techniques, and the social redefinition of needs and aspirations all play a role in the rise of sociotechnical systems.
   * Sociotechnical systems are silent, the relatively insignificant role played by human language against nonverbal communication in ritual as a coordinator of technical activities.
   * Sociotechnical systems produce power and meaning as well as goods.
   * All human sociotechnical systems, whether "primitive" or "preindustrial," are enormously complex and inherently heterogeneous.
   * Sociotechnical systems also betray a charac­teristic life cycle as they grow from invention, small-scale innovation, growth and development, and a climax of maximum elaboration and scope, followed by senescence and decay until the system disappears or is replaced by a competing system.
	
	==To conclude, the sociotechnical system concept puts forward a universal conception of human technological activity, in which complex social structures, nonverbal activity systems, advanced linguistic communication, the ritual coordination of labour, advanced artefact manufac­ture, the linkage of phenomenally diverse social and nonsocial actors, and the social use of diverse artefacts are all recognised as parts of a single complex that is simultaneously adaptive and expressive.==
3. What is the **Standard View of Technology**?
   > According to the Standard view, tool use is authentic and fosters autonomy; one owns and controls one's own tools and isn't dependent on or exploited by others. When we use machines, in contrast, we must work at rhythms, not of our own making, and we become ensnared in the supralocal relations necessary for their production, distribution, and main­tenance. To the extent that we become dependent on machines we do not own, the stage is set for exploitation. We become divorced from nature, and our conceptions of the world become pathological through a process called reifi­cation (a malady frequently asserted to occur only in industrial societies).

   **Key features**:
   - ==Necessity is the mother of invention.==
     Invention is purely utilitarian and is unrelated to culture. A need-driven technological evolution is presumed.
     Technology and material culture form the primary means by which people establish their viability, given the constraints imposed upon them by their environment and the demands of social integration.
   - ==Form follows function.==
     For an artefact, *Function* directly enhances the Darwinian fitness of the population in which it occurs. In contrast, *Form* is a secondary decoration symbolising group solidarity.
   - ==Unilinear progression from simple tools to complex machines.==
     Technology is cumulative, there was a movement from primitive sensorimotor skills (techniques) to highly elaborate systems of objective, linguistically encoded knowledge about nature and its potential (technology). Technology was more authentic when we used tools because we could control them.
   - ==The *Rupture* was the Industrial Revolution.==
     We now live in a *homogeneous* world of functionally driven design coherence. Our culture has become inauthentic in which reified images of technology predominate. 
     According to the doctrine of Rupture, reification occurs because we employ objects as a means of knowing ourselves. When these objects are no longer our own authentic products, as is the case with industrially produced artefacts, our attention is deflected from critical self-awareness to the incompletely under­stood "other" who generates the artefact.
1. What defines **necessity**?
   ==Culture, not nature, defines necessity== i.e. *need is not universal*. Various techniques and artefacts can be chosen to accomplish a *utilitarian* objective. 
   The supposed functions of artefacts do not provide a clear portrait of a human culture's needs.
2. How do we define **technology** better?
   Technology has to be defined separately as *Technique*, which refers to the system of material resources, tools, operational sequences and skills, verbal and nonverbal knowledge, and specific modes of work coordination that come into play in the fabrication of material artefacts; and *Sociotechnical* system, in contrast, which refers to the distinctive technological activ­ity that stems from the linkage of techniques and material culture to the social coordination of labour.
   Those who seek to develop new technologies must be concerned not only with techniques and artefacts but also with engineering the technology's social, economic, legal, scientific, and political context.
   
   > Means by which man seeks to modify or control his natural environment. - Spier 
   > It is an unsatisfactory definition because techniques and artefacts are secondary to labour's social coordination in shaping human adaptations.
3. What is the **principle of symmetry**?
   The principle of symmetry calls for precisely the same kind of social explanation to be used in accounting for the success and failure of a theory or, by exten­sion, of a socio-technical system.
   It counters the older sociology of science, which explained the success of a theory by its conformity to the "Truth" while ascribing the failure of another theory to social factors (bias, influence, "interests," etc).
4. Do sociotechnical systems show imprints of the contexts they arose from?
   Sociotechnical-system building is inevitably *sociogenic*: Society is the result of sociotechnical-system building. Any sociotechnical system shows the imprint of its context since system builders must draw on existing social and cultural re­sources. But it is important to stress that every sociotechnical system is, in principle, a de novo construct; to make the system work, system builders draw from existing resources but modify them to make them function within the system.
   
   > People construct their social world using the social resources and structures at hand, but their activities modify the structures even as they are reproduced.
5. What roles do **rituals** play in sociotechnical systems?
   Ritual works surpassingly well to coordinate labour under condi­tions of statelessness or local autonomy and the network's legitimation. They provide a metacommentary on the entire productive process.
6. What are an artefact's **affordances**?
    An affordance is a perceived property of an artefact that suggests how it should be used. Affordances are inherently multiple: Differing perceptions lead to different uses.
7. Explain the example of **Victorian Hallway**?
    What appears in a naive analysis to be the superficial matter of "style" (the bench's austerity) turns out to be the very "function" of the artefact (to remind servants of their status). The function of the artefact (to be attractive to masters and remind servants of their station) can be known only by comprehending the perceived social role that the artefact is designed to fulfil; this perceived social role, in turn, can be known only from a contextual analysis that fully explores the dimensions of Victorian class sensibilities.
    
    >  Style is the function.
8. What roles do artefacts play in a ritual context?
    Artefacts play key roles in *framing* ritual activities, providing cues that establish the cultural significance of the events.
9. What is **technological drama**?
    If no form of domination goes unresisted, then one would expect artefacts to be employed in redressive rituals specifically designed to mute or counter the dominant ritual system's invidious status implications of the dominant ritual system.
    In this process, each new act of ritual framing is a statement in an ongoing dialogue of ritual statements and counterstatements. In counterstatements, people whose status is adversely affected by rituals try to obtain or modify valued artefacts in an attempt to blunt or subvert the dominant rituals' implications. These statements and their subsequent counterstatements help to constitute social relations as a polity. Redressive technological activities, which are inter­pretive responses to technological domination, highlight the political dimen­sion of technology. This *polity*-building process is *technological drama*.
    
    > A technological drama's statements and counterstatements draw upon a culture's root paradigms and axioms about social life; consequently, technological activities bring entrenched moral imperatives into prominence.
10. What constitutes a **technological drama**?
    - ==Tech­nological regularisation==
      Design constituency creates, appropriates, or modifies a techno­logical production process, artefact, user activity, or system so that some of its technical features embody a political aim, an intention to alter the allocation of power, prestige, or wealth. 
      Like texts, the technological processes and artefacts generated by techno­logical regularisation are subject to multiple interpretations, in which the dominating discourse may be challenged tacitly or openly.
    - ==Technological adjustment==
      Impact constituencies—the people who lose when a new production process or artefact is introduced—engage in strategies to compen­sate for the loss of self-esteem, social prestige, and social power caused by the technology. In this process, they use contradictions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies within the hegemonic frame of meaning as they try to validate their actions. They try to control and alter the discourse that affects them so invidiously, and they try to alter the discursively regulated social contexts that regularisation creates.
    - ==Technological recon­stitution==
      Impact constituencies try to reverse the implications of technology through a symbolic inversion process called "*antisignification*". Reconstitution can lead to the fabrication of counter artefacts or "appropriate technology," which embody features believed to negate or re­verse the political implications of the dominant system.
11. What do preindustrial and contemporary societies have in common? What are the universals of human technology and material culture?
    Despite the rise of Consumer Culture, consumer cultures have much in common with preindustrial societies: Artefacts are multiplied, elaborated, appropriated, and em­ployed in framing activities as a form of self-knowledge and self-definition.
    Both rely ex­tensively on nonverbal cognition, both show enormous complexity and elabo­ration, and both seem to generate reified notions rather than "authentic" self-awareness.
    ==One can suggest, in fact, that both modern devices and preindustrial systems of ritual coordination are machines.==
    A preindustrial sociotechnical system unifies material, ritual, and so­cial resources in a comprehensive strategy for societal reproduction. Many, if not most, individuals find themselves playing dependent and exploited roles as a result of participation in such a system. Reification is by no means restricted to industrial technology.
12. What is a **machine**?
    > A machine, as the name implies, is, first of all, a machination, a stratagem, a kind of cunning, where borrowed forces keep one another in check so that none can fly apart from the group. - Latour
13. What is **technological determinism**?
    It is a doctrine that states because there is only one way to make or use a material artefact, every culture that adopts it will be forced to develop the same social and labour relations.
    
    > The "recipient" (appropriating) culture can reinterpret the transferred artefact as it sees fit; the adoption of artefacts does not necessarily imply the adoption of the system of logic that produced the technology.

## Notes

1. Language, tool use, and social behaviour evolved through complex mutual interaction and feedback.
2. Technology is seen through the Modernist lens as both creator and destroyer, an agent of future promise and culture's destruction. *It is an extraordinary compound of the futurist and the nihilistic, the revolutionary and the conservative, the romantic and the classical*.
3. Technology, in concert with the social coordination of labour, constitutes a human population's adaptation to its environment.
4. A system builder faces natural and social adversaries, each of which must be controlled and modified if the system is to work. Although constructing a system resistant to dissociation is difficult, sociotechnical systems are not inevitable responses to immutable constraints; they do not provide the only way to achieve a goal. It would be wrong to attribute a system's "success" (i.e. in resisting dissociation) to the choice of the "cor­rect" technique or social coordination method.
5. A successful sociotechnical system achieves a stable integration of social and nonsocial actors. Still, it is not static: Maintaining the network requires constant vigilance and may require additional technical or social modification.
6. Every sociotechnical system must cope with *reverse salients*, areas of obduracy or resistance that prevent the system from expanding or threaten it with dissociation
7. The distinction between "function" and "style" is a product of the *decontextualisa­tion* and *dehistoricisation* of artefacts.
8. Constructing a sociotechnical system is not merely engaging in some creative or productive activity. It brings to life a deeply desired vision of social life, often with a degree of fervour that can only be termed millenarian.
9. Much technological knowledge is learned, stored, and transmitted by experiential learning, visual/spatial thinking, and analogical reasoning. The portion of technical knowledge that people can verbalise represents only the tip of the iceberg.
10. Action has an emergent quality which results from the continual feedback from external events to internal representations and from the internal representations back to enactment. Crucial to this process is equally flexible cycling among alternative cognitive modes, including visual/spatial thinking and linguistic/classificatory thinking.
11. De-localization is the irreversible growth of dependence on nonlocal energy sources.

## Summary

The document explores **material culture**, **sociotechnical systems**, and the **standard view of technology**, focusing on how humans interact with technology and artefacts. Here’s a condensed summary:

#### 1. **Material Culture**

Material culture includes the **physical objects** people create and use, reflecting their **values, beliefs, and social structures**. These artefacts provide insight into human identity and interaction with the environment.

#### 2. **Sociotechnical Systems**

Sociotechnical systems integrate **social and material components** to achieve common goals. These systems include **techniques, tools, and labor coordination. They are flexible, shaped by **social choice** and context, and follow a life cycle from **innovation to decay**.

#### 3. **Standard View of Technology**

The standard view sees technology as **utilitarian**, evolving from simple tools to complex machines. **Tool use** fosters autonomy, while **machines** create dependencies and exploitation. The **Industrial Revolution** marked a rupture, leading to a world driven by inauthentic, function-based design.

#### 4. **Technological Drama**

**Technological drama** refers to using technology in rituals to assert or challenge social power. This process involves **redressive actions** that challenge the status quo, highlighting the **political dimensions of technology**.

#### 5. **Technological Determinism**:

Technological determinism suggests that technology shapes society fixedly, but the document challenges this, emphasising that **cultures reinterpret technologies** based on their own needs.

#### Conclusion:

Technology and material culture are deeply tied to **social structures** and **cultural meaning**, resisting static interpretations and highlighting the **adaptive** nature of human interaction with technology.
