## Cues

1. What form should my presentation take? (conceptual prototype, interface mockup, film or animation, poster)
   Conceptual Prototype
2. Critiques about AI in religion?
   - **The commodification of Spirituality:** AI chatbots and tools often reduce complex spiritual traditions to transactional Q&A or superficial engagement.
   - **Lack of Inclusivity:** Whose beliefs and interpretations get programmed into AI? Are minority religions represented fairly?
   - **Cultural Homogenisation:** AI can inadvertently impose dominant cultural or religious norms over diverse spiritual traditions.
   - **Automation vs. Authenticity:** Does using AI in religious practices diminish the sacredness or authenticity of the experience?
3. 

## Notes

1. Religion is causing division among people instead of being a guide to achieving spirituality
2. Hyper-localised religious assistants or guides in a multi-agent system that helps you pave your own path
3. Only certain individuals acquire religious knowledge, and most stick to one religion; very few are learned on multiple faiths, and even those who are may have inherent biases due to the environment they come from
4. **AI as an Interfaith Mediator**
   **Concept:** Develop an AI system called _Ekklesia_, designed to foster interfaith dialogue and understanding.
   **Features:**
    - Interactive storytelling merges spiritual narratives from different traditions to find common ethical threads.
    - A platform for sharing personal spiritual journeys, with AI drawing connections between seemingly disparate beliefs.
    - Redistribution of knowledge by showcasing underrepresented faiths and indigenous spiritual practices.
    **Social Impact:** Encourages empathy, reduces religious biases, and promotes harmony in increasingly pluralistic societies.

## Summary

- Clearly explain the problem with current AI development you have identified and want to challenge through your work. Explain the broader relevance of this problem (up to 1 min)

What is the problem?
Creating an AI model is resource-intensive, meaning only a few organisations will have the power to control what they make and how they make it. 
The data they collect to train these models could be implicitly biased. They might not consider the positionality of the engineers who build the systems and may not have enough regulations to accommodate the intersectionality of the audience they serve.
The concentration of power among a few individuals will cause further subjugation of minorities or, even worse, homogenisation of cultures, causing the many diverse spiritual traditions to vanish. 
Especially if the organisations are for-profit, they often overlook the need for diversity and inclusivity.
I see religion as a tool that a person can use to get closer to their God, but letting loose something as powerful as AI to only some people, especially when it's centrally regulated, will cause even more fractures in the fabric of our society. It could lead to the spread of misinformation, profiling, privacy issues and end-user manipulation. [1]


- Showcase your proposal for intervention ( approx 3 min) and

Technicalities of the system?
Shep-AI-rd is a multi-agent LLM system with various base LLM models based on languages included and can add more on the go. There are base agents that are fine-tuned on broader religions and can spawn more children that are further fine-tuned on how these religions have been adopted and transformed by various cultures and how they are practised today. 
The above-mentioned step is the most cost-intensive and would be decentralised and done by various organisations dedicated to inter-religious harmony, so there are inclusive rules in place for its growth. This will be possible in the near future as the cost of GPUs keeps falling and training becomes more affordable and less demanding. 
The agents could use RAG systems (retrieval augmented generation systems) to capture data on the go (transcribed videos of masses held at churches, for example). This would allow each minority to have a database that collects their day-to-day proceedings and a co-creative guide along their journey. 
All these agents come under the same platform, meaning someone in search of information can see a multitude of answers from their faith and if they want to see similar information from others.
Interface User Facing:
1. Hyper Personalised Religious Guide that you can build through conversation with an AI
2. Knowledge Repository of all Religions that have been captured
3. Ability to accept requests from religions not yet covered in the repository
4. AI-curated interfaith discussions and forums
5. Interactive storytelling merging spiritual narratives
6. Tools for users to share and connect through personal spiritual journeys

- Clearly articulate how the proposal addresses the problem you have identified and how it challenges the status quo (up to 1 minute). 

There are many religious AI apps, such as Ask Jesus, Ganesh GPT, Jewish Prayer Chatbot, and many more, but no single application can help you find your path to God. The problem with such standalone religious chatbots is that they fail to make people understand the underlying similarities between religions. 
The truth is people are different. They come from many diverse environments and experiences, and we need religious help catering to each of them on a hyper-personal level, embracing the differences and, at the same time, showing them the underlying similarities that make them feel connected to others. 
If we have decentralised entities that cater to the needs of their communities while at the same time showing them other perspectives that build tolerance, we can truly overcome the division such a disruptive technology can create.
To live in harmony, we need to embrace diversity and educate people about the positionality of others. Even among the most dissimilar cultures, there is much in common.

## Final Report

Q: Describe the current situation in your domain and what changes AI is expected to bring about, as discussed in the popular press. (300-500 words max)  
A: Media has become so big today that we could, in fact, call so many views of a certain matter "popular". One thing that we can justify with numbers is that there is certainly a global decline in religious affliction and identity[^1], potentially the aftermath of the proliferation of AI and robotics (automation). Religion is a basis for morality, and its decline could be troubling. It has been observed that countries with a larger stock of robots saw a decline in religiosity, and countries with less exposure saw a slight uptick[^1]. Several other studies have shown a link between automation and religious decline[^1]. Throughout history, religion has been instrumental in solving problems beyond human comprehension and, at the same time, giving a sense of ethical conduct to the masses. But is AI and automation are ready to fill these big shoes is a question to ponder.
Some religions are opening doors for AI and experimenting with how it can be used in their practices. For example, Minder is a humanoid robot that gives sermons in Kyoto at a Zen Buddhist temple[^2] or a recent installation of an "AI Jesus" that takes confessions in Switzerland[^3]. There is also talk of religions devoted to the worship of AI[^4]. This could mean we could have religions without a hierarchy and spawn many new sub-religions with their own doctrines, but at the same time, it could pose risks and compel followers to do dangerous or destructive things. It has pros and cons, but we must wait to see how it really plays out. 
We also see many AI-based religious chatbots, like Ask Jesus, Ganesh GPT, Hadith GPT, etc[^5]. This means more mass accessibility, easier education, virtual assistance and digital archives[^5]. This opens up ways of interacting with religion, which was impossible before. So many people who were devoid of help have the opportunity to get the help they deserve at their fingertips finally. 
As I've discussed, the proliferation of AI technology has its merits, but it also paves the way for much damage. Misinformation and misrepresentation already exist in the context of faith. AI could help or make things worse with deepfake images and voice clones or be used maliciously to promote propaganda[^6]. It could also cause the homogenisation of cultures because of how it is made. 
There is so much discussion that it is evident that religion and AI are hot topics. As long as we have an open dialogue about them, people will have a chance to see the various positionalities of others, and we can hope for a better future.


Q: Zoom in on the concerns and the critique aimed at current AI applications/approaches to AI that you want to address. Explain what issues regarding the status quo the critique challenges. What actors/practices/institutions/norms & values (aka socio-technical system) are involved in maintaining it – try to ground it to real places and contexts, using concrete examples rather than staying at an abstract level. Explain who benefits more from the status quo, who is less, and who is harmed. Provide a good overview of the concerns/critique and how they relate to the problem they want to address. Who is resisting the critique, and who is welcoming it? (800-1000 words)  
A: AI has developed rapidly and has become such a huge thing, especially since the wide-scale adoption of GenAI. We see so many competitors in the tech world that OpenAI's ChatGPT has become a word synonymous with Google, and who could have seen that coming a few years ago? The problem now is that the hype around AI is overshadowing the real cost of training these models, whether in the case of exploited labour or in the environmental damage it causes. 
There are many things to cover, but I want to focus on data. The centralised approach we see today is worrisome. Creating an AI model is resource-intensive, meaning only a few organisations will have the power to control what they make and how they make it. Especially if the organisations are for-profit, they often overlook the need for diversity and inclusivity. 
When data is collected in such an environment, the benefactors will often overlook the implicit bias in the data they use to train the models. It is a proactive process to understand that data has a bias because, for a million reasons, when we treat it as a reactive process, it leads to the spread of misinformation and profiling and the growth of malicious agents that will take advantage of the minorities[^5][^6]. 
Concentrating power among a few individuals will further subjugate minorities or, even worse, homogenise cultures, causing the many diverse spiritual traditions to vanish. We need this process to be decentralised if we aim for a harmonious future in which different faith practitioners get along, and tolerance is the norm rather than a virtue to look forward to. We need to consider intersectionality and the audience to which such applications will cater in the future. 
Religion is a tool that a person can use to get closer to their God, but letting loose something as powerful as AI to only some people, especially when it's centrally regulated, will cause even more fractures in the fabric of our society. 
For example, we consider cases where AI chatbots are based on the doctrines of only a single religion, like Ask Jesus[^3]. The bishops, priests and the religious clergy played a central role in the social structure. They are inclined to be biased towards propagating Christianity, and the scholars and monks who helped teach new clergy and preserve knowledge, respectively, would have had biases in how they capture information. An extreme example of this could be the KKK, which has used religious symbols as artefacts for rituals in the past[^7]. Even though I have taken an anomalous example, we are well aware that religious terrorism is not an uncommon thing when there is an unspoken rule that dictates that conversion to one custom is ideal. The rest who believe otherwise should be subjugated. The religions we all know so well are thousands of years old and have been through so many different eras of different social needs; these socio-technical systems are made in such a way the actors who are involved gain benefit certain things like money or power for the sacrifice of conforming and propagating its doctrines. 
Some artefacts like the sacred text (the Bible) are the foundational text of Christian doctrine; the social glue keeps the community together more than a reservoir of knowledge. These have been misquoted so many times, like in the case of the Christian Identity moment[^8], which spread anti-Semitic ideas. We can see here that so many cultures have adopted religion and have been made their own, sometimes in detrimental ways to society. A centralised system will have biased actors who will abuse the artefacts and rituals to create more division, and this causes the homogenisation of various cultures and may even eradicate some traditions for good, as we have seen throughout history. A tool as powerful as AI is not something that only a few should be able to use because it will just be used to spread misinformation and hate. It could be a catastrophe in the making that causes unprecedented subjugation.
We have seen that Cambridge Analytica has been used before for profiling[^9]; this is the perfect example of how minorities could be suppressed and targeted if such AI tools are centrally controlled and only accessible to a few. There should be an organisation that promotes harmony with participants from different religions and acts as a proactive advocate for more practitioners to join so that we understand the underlying similarities in religion and how it helps people with spirituality rather than divides them. The status quo right now helps the bigger religions but marginalises the smaller ones without the resources. Here, we must address that data of all religions are equally important, and no single religious chatbot is what the world needs. Academics and intellectuals have started to see such technologies' importance and impact on society. Many have taken an interest in this and are bringing it to a greater audience so that people can be educated on the new wave of change AI will bring. One example I would like to cite is the *Web3 Fusion: AI and Beyond conference* held in Bangkok in April 2024[^10]. Keynote speakers hailed from various countries, including the United States, Brazil, Greece, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. We can see that people are critiquing and welcoming it, which shows promise for a better future.


Q: Introduce your ‘intervention’/re-articulate what AI could be (your Proposal). Explain how it addresses the challenge you have identified. Explain how it provides or aligns with the critique of current AI applications/approaches to AI and/or their societal implications within your domain. (400-800 words max) 
A: The cost associated with AI development is why power accumulates centrally. We now see a trend that indicates that the cost of GPUs, which are essential for training these models, is dipping, and we hope that it will soon reach a point where it is accessible to more of the public. In light of this, I aim to speculate on certain breakthroughs in AI that will make "Shep-AI-rd", which I will talk more about later on, possible. One of the problems with LLMs is that most of these models have a tokenisation strategy dependent on English as a language. This in itself is something that will change soon when more base models that have different strategies for multiple languages will arise. This will eliminate a lot of bias in the data because of the improvement in contextual understanding. Shep-AI-rd is a multi-modal AI platform trained on all broader religions and can be fine-tuned on more data specific to the cultural adoption of these religions. It also has the ability to accrue data on the go using RAG systems that enable it to store and retrieve real-time data, an example scenario of this could be capturing what happens in a mass through audio or video transcription. This enables multiple AI agents to grow alongside the multitude of religions out there. 
The technical details put forth for discussion above help us understand how we can create a decentralised platform that caters to more than one religion and that has the capability to onboard more religions as it grows bigger. We are able to finally disperse power and make it accessible to more of the public. The biggest achievement here is that we can have a platform promoting interfaith dialogue, which is currently missing in standalone apps like Ganesh GPT, Ask Jesus, Jewish Prayer Chatbot, and much more. The problem with such standalone religious chatbots is that they fail to make people understand the underlying similarities between religions. We can finally have organisations that promote tolerance between various practitioners by focussing on the similarities underlying their customs and traditions and bridging the gap that has been formed over the years. 
Homogenisation of cultures is a threat centralisation has, but a platform with repositories for all cultures could mitigate this risk. AI-curated discussion boards for dialogue for open topics across religions can work as a source of truth or at least a way for people to gauge the positionality of others, and this could control the spread of misinformation. 
The truth is that people are different. They come from many diverse environments and experiences, and we need religious help catering to each of them on a hyper-personal level, embracing their differences while showing them the underlying similarities that make them feel connected to others. If we have decentralised entities that cater to the needs of their communities while also showing them other perspectives that build tolerance, we can truly overcome the division such a disruptive technology can create.
I see religion as a tool for people to get closer to God. However, allowing something as powerful as AI to be available only to some people, especially when it's centralised, will cause even more fractures in our society's fabric. To live in harmony, we need to embrace diversity and educate people about the positionality of others. Even among the most dissimilar cultures, there is much in common. Shep-AI-rd can herald such an era of acceptance and tolerance.


Q: Reflect on speculative interventions such as this project's role in creating alternative visions about AI. What has this project meant for your thinking about what AI is and what it could be? (300-500 words)   
A: We live in a fast-paced world where it is impossible to really take a moment, pause and think about what is happening. We live in a promise of a future rather than realising the present state. AI has always been a tool that gives you an advantage in the rat race, which was the case for me before this course and the assignments. Some of the concepts I had to work through, even though it might seem obvious, were very challenging. AI has a very disruptive presence, especially because it can be used to generate deepfakes, and this is a major concern as it could spread misinformation. This overshadowed my thought process, and I never had to address my positionality. 
Speculating on interventions gave me a new perspective on AI and its applications. I could see what was happening right now and was equipped with the tools to question things intersectionally. I imagine a world where people could learn about various cultures not from an outsider's eyes but from real accounts of people who actually practice these traditions. All these agents come under the same platform, meaning someone searching for information can see many answers from their faith and, if they want, similar information from others. This paves the way for something that has been missing all this while but is a crucial element for a better future: interfaith dialogue. I could go from a purely critical and cynical viewpoint to a more optimistic one, and this was not something that I took lightly. 
I finally had the opportunity to use my knowledge of technology and envision something that could benefit society rather than exploit it like the many corporations today. This experience showed me how much popular media and corporations shape how people see AI and revealed the dark underbelly of AI that lies behind all the hype. It gave me a chance to envision a future where power was truly distributed and there was tolerance and dialogue among the masses.
