## Cues

- What is positionality?
	- Acknowledges the context in which someone’s identity exists and emphasises self-awareness of how one’s identity influences their worldview, power, and bias.
	- In the context of AI - how do the social identities, backgrounds, and perspectives of those involved in AI design shape the resulting technologies?
	- It requires a self-awareness of one’s own position and biases, acknowledging the limitations of one’s own viewpoint.
- Speculative Everything - Design, Fiction and Social Dreaming
	- Chapter 1
		- Predicting or Forecasting the Future - Pointless Activity
		- The idea of possible futures and using them as tools to understand the present better and to discuss the kind of future people want, and, of course, ones people do not want
		- Their fictional nature requires viewers to suspend their disbelief and allow their imaginations to wander, to forget how things are now momentarily, and wonder about how things could be
		- Requires new design roles, contexts, and method
		- To find inspiration for speculating through design, we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art to explore, hybridise, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideas— fictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on.
		- Probable
		- Plausible
		- Possible
		- Fantasy
		- Probable + Plausible = Preferable 
		- Designers should not define futures for everyone else but work with experts, including ethicists, political scientists, economists, and so on, to generate futures that act as catalysts for public debate and discussion about the kinds of futures people really want.
		- We need more pluralism in design, not of style but of ideology and values.
	- Chapter 3
		- To be human is to refuse to accept the given as given.
		- There are many possibilities: socially engaged design to raise awareness, satire and critique, inspiration, reflection, highbrow entertainment, aesthetic explorations, speculation about possible futures, and as a catalyst for change.
		- Critical design is critical thought translated into materiality. It is about thinking through design rather than through words and using the language and structure of design to engage people.
		- The gap between reality as we know it and the different ideas of reality referred to in the critical design proposal creates space for discussion. 
		- Critical design aims to help us become more discerning consumers and encourage people to demand more from industry and society as critical consumers.
		- Design can help raise awareness of the consequences of our actions as citizen-consumers.
		- Dark, complex emotions are usually ignored in design; nearly every other culture area accepts that people are complicated, contradictory, and even neurotic, but not design. 
		- A skilful use of satire and irony can engage the audience constructively by appealing to the imagination and engaging the intellect.
		- By generating alternatives, critical design can help people construct compasses rather than maps for navigating new values.

## Q and A

Q: Dunne and Raby (2013) outline some key changes that have happened since the 1970s, which, according to them, "_make imaginative, social, and political speculation_" at the time of publishing their book "_more difficult and less likely_". They conclude, "_Now, a younger generation doesn’t dream, it hopes; it hopes that we will survive, that there will be water for all, that we will be able to feed everyone, that we will not destroy ourselves._” p.9. 

How do you relate to such a statement personally and professionally? Reflect briefly on how you are positioned in relation to the contexts they describe (you can draw on the concept of _positionality;_ refer to Class 7 slides, if necessary).

A: As a child, you are often shielded from the world's inequalities. I was fortunate enough to have been raised in an environment where I could share my dreams and aspirations with others in the community; I was naive enough to think that the sky was the limit and that everyone I grew up with would have it the same. I was always taught that education was the only thing I should be concerned with. I blindly believed this for the longest time, but now I realise it was because of how little I was exposed to media; all I had was time to study, and I never really got to see how the world was around me. The minute I stepped into university and professional life, I suddenly realised I was living in a fantasy world; my worldview was too removed from how the world is.
As I began to see the world for what it was, I started living in the "probable" world. I understood what education entailed and how not everyone had equal chances to survive, even in a world without financial crashes, natural disasters, or war. However, I remained optimistic that I was on the right path by choosing education over others.
I was still ignorant, but the more you see, the more you cannot unsee. By the time I was in my 20s, my worldview had changed from one driven by ambition as a dreamer to mere survival. The floods of 2018[^1] in Kerala showed me how life, as you know it, could change instantly. Suddenly, I saw how cultural, political, and economic factors could impact one's life so much. It is on the brink of losing one's house and possibly dying that one puts things into perspective.
I could see how technology was used to help many people, raise funds, give voice to the voiceless, and predict future calamities. I had started to see the "plausible" world as the authors define it. From here, it was a downhill slope. I saw Cambridge Analytica[^2] in action, causing large-scale panic; I saw Corona sweep through and leave people helpless and how fake news spread[^3]; I saw how my government was promoting a "right-Hindu" nation, all of this powered by technology and how the people in charge of these design choices could abuse it to kill the dreams of millions. 
I was scared to see how machine learning, in its infancy, could do so much. I agree with the authors when they say, "Now, a younger generation doesn’t dream; it hopes; it hopes that we will survive, that there will be water for all, that we will be able to feed everyone, that we will not destroy ourselves." I have seen both sides of the coin. The advent of GenAI makes these concerns even more relevant; it can be used to spread misinformation and cause more division among people. In the context of religion, which is something that should hold together the fundamental fabric of society, this misinformation can cause catastrophic damage[^4].  Such a cynical viewpoint can only get you so far; AI can enable new design roles, contexts, and methods to generate futures that act as catalysts for public debate and discussion about the kinds of futures people really want. Among the many possibilities are socially engaged design to raise awareness, satire and critique, inspiration, reflection, highbrow entertainment, aesthetic explorations, speculation about possible futures, and as a catalyst for change. The right design choices with AI raise awareness of citizen-consumer actions. AI has the power to bring people to their feet, but at the same time, it has the ability to save so many people. It can enable education among the masses, and as I learned the hard way, education (positional awareness) will save us all. 


Q: Benjamin (2024) calls for the need to create 'new stories' (p.17) as a way to bring more just futures for everyone. According to her, what is the role of critical thinking and liberating imagination in this process? Connect her concerns about 'arrested imagination' (p. 39) with the concerns about 'thoughtlessness' that Browne (2023) describes building up on the work of Hanna Arendt. Explain how they, according to the authors, prevent creating different futures. How do you relate to this line of thinking?
A: The author says we should move away from the old rhetorics prevalent in our society, such as The Doctrine of Discovery, Manifest Destiny and Survival of the Fittest. They talk about deadly stories of entitlement and domination, yet they continue to infect our collective imagination, distorting how we see and value different groups, cultures and worldviews. Critical thinking will help us discard inherited lies that glorify hierarchy, monopoly, and greed. Only through liberating our imagination can we envision a future where "weakness" itself is imagined differently. We would be able to write new stories that engender solidarity, mutuality, and shared prosperity. 
According to the author, four institutions carry these outmoded stories: religions, governments, corporations and universities. Furthermore, far-out tales of utopian futures shadow the problems people face now, like racism, sexism, or imperialism. Even climate change is not high on the list of priorities so long as some people (the rich) survive to ensure eventual digital descendants. This falls back into the "ends justify the means" past that has caused such atrocities. The proponents of "longtermism" have taken up the imagination space that is equally rightful to each and every one of us. Unless we teach our children and grandchildren the need for critical thinking, we will succumb to poverty, climate change or catastrophic wars. Liberating our imagination will keep those monopolising the resources from monopolising the collective imagination. 
The times we live in now make it easier to see what the author talks about. Even though it is visible, it is hard to challenge, and people often fall back into the systems that are made to keep them in the rat race. Liberating our imagination is easy, but making a practical change is hard. The author mentions examples of exemplary individuals, but this may be impossible for the everyday man. It might be easier for a "white male" to make a difference with their imagination, but for the rest of the world, it's still based on luck more than hard work. The only way I can ensure my survival is to hustle, focus on education, earn money and hope my future generations can grow this wealth to a point where they are not bound by the shackles of the system they are born into.
The author discusses "arrested imagination" and how deep social fault lines and inequalities impact everyday life and our ability to reimagine the world. A techno-utopian, eugenic imagination that seeks to colonise all ways of thinking and being in the world threatens our shared imagination. This relates to Browne's argument that structural injustice will prevail when people habitually do not reflect critically, especially when it affects marginalised groups. It is not mere negligence but societal complacency when adopting technology without questioning its implications and how it perpetuates injustice. While efficient, the increased reliance on automated systems will further decrease humanity's capacity for critical thinking and erode our ability to imagine a future where people are seen as equal.
While I agree with the author in certain ways, investing in transforming our social reality as much as our material reality seems like a first-world problem for me, coming from a country trying to get out of a third-world state. From where I am positioned to see the world, if I had been educated in humanities, I would be out of a job and barely making a living back in India. I would not have had the opportunity to continue my studies abroad. Having seen the class divide in action and still being fresh out of poverty, many of my family still battling poverty, technology and studying technology equipped me with the tools to move forward and is, in fact, ensuring my survival. The author's examples of white countries that have had hundreds of years to amass wealth via colonisation are definitely not a relatable topic for the rest of the world, which is struggling. I have seen that technology enables jobs that have helped hundreds of people survive. While I sympathise with the plights of such people compared to millionaires, they have opportunities that were absent before. These concepts apply once the people responsible for colonisation and capitalism take responsibility or are held accountable for their actions. 

Word count: Flexible. Most importantly, you understand the author's arguments and share your reflection. I would not expect that you need more than 500 words in total, but if you do, go at it. We will look for 1) an understanding of the authors' perspectives and connecting those to 2) your own reflection about the times and the world you live in.
