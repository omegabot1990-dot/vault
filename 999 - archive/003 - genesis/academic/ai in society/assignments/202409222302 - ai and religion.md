## How do I see religion?

Merriam-Webster defines religion as,
1. a personal set or institutionalised system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices
2. the service and worship of God or the supernatural / commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance
3. a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardour and faith
While the definitions above explain the essence of religion, they are far from giving one a holistic view of religion. One could argue that religion is somewhat of an "emotion" and, like most human emotions, I feel, is beyond the capabilities of today's language to do justice to it. In other words, religion is a subjective reality. 
Growing up in a place where Christianity, Islam and Hinduism coexisted in harmony, I was subjected to a lot of ideas about what religion should be. They were all so different but so similar simultaneously, and it has always been a source of amazement to me. Religion has definitely taken me on a ride, from being brought up as a pantheist sect of a polytheistic religion surrounded by people who worshipped a monotheistic god and finally landing on being an agnostic at the end of the day. 
Having seen both sides of the coin when it comes to religion, whether it be love and belonging that brings people together or hate and resentment that tears people apart, I've finally come to the conclusion that religion is nothing but a machine, and I was merely a cog in it.
I believe fear and faith are separated by a fine line, and religion is a machine built on this fundamental truth. As Latour puts it so flawlessly, "A machine, as the name implies, is, first of all, a machination, a stratagem, a kind of cunning, where borrowed forces keep one another in check so that none can fly apart from the group." and in this context if you really think about it, there is bound to be *drama*. 
The feeling of being powerless is indeed something that could bring a man to his knees. Still, having worked closely with science and technology and followed the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, I feel like I've been given the agency to make a difference. I feel religion, even though there may be malignant players in the system, could amount to so much more than it has been and could be the way toward a truly enlightened society one day.
Reading Pfaffenberger was somewhat enlightening; it felt like I could put words to things I had been feeling and trying to express for years, and I felt it was necessary to acknowledge this fact before I moved on to the tasks at hand.

## What's happening now in AI and Religion?

Recent studies have noticed a trend that indicates a global decline in religious affiliation and identity. One potential factor is the proliferation of automation in our lives, whether it be simple technology or more advanced ones such as robotics and artificial intelligence. One prominent metric is people's exposure to technology; the more one is exposed, the fewer chances you have of having faith. Philosophers and researchers have long pondered the connection between science and religion, but prior research has not supported a strong "disenchantment" effect. Still, the advent of AI seems to show otherwise. 
Throughout history, people have deferred to religion to solve problems beyond the scope of human ability; one could say there was a cultural need to find answers from something "supernatural," and AI could indeed be a new sociotechnical system that has borrowed from its predecessors to establish a new status quo.
Another place where religion shines is in defining morality; people follow the rules because of their fear of faith, which, as I mentioned before, is separated by a fine line. If you were to follow the news, we live in a world of questionable morality filled with war and famine. AI could instil fear or command faith. Could AI be the "second coming" the world needs today?
Now, let's delve into a more technical viewpoint; we know that to understand religion truly, we need to inspect it as a sociotechnical system that was part of a certain culture. Religious texts are often incomplete and far from contextually rich, sometimes in long-lost languages and with poor reinterpretations. This leads to misinformation and misrepresentation, leading to religion being used as a tool to spread hate. AI could create a more defined representation of what religion was meant to do and could one day be a "Priest" or an "Imam". AI could be a leader, a shepherd if you will, to guide the masses towards God. 
Just as I mentioned the idealist's view on AI, I should definitely mention the more realistic threats that AI poses, too. AI being used to create and spread propaganda is a real issue today; deep fake images and voice cloning are menaces that can wreak havoc if they are not controlled and regulated. In a sense, AI could conform to a modernist view of technology as both creator and destroyer, an agent of future promise and culture's destruction. 
Another problem could be that AI-based religions have several doctrines that could cause the proliferation of disputes and lead to conflict and disorder; they could also force their followers to do dangerous or destructive things. 
In writing this report, I have chosen the path of an idealist rather than a pessimist because, in my honest opinion, AI can bring more good than bad at this infancy stage.

## What would Pfaffenberger say?

One myth that you can identify without much effort is seeing artificial intelligence as an agent of the Rupture that the Industrial Revolution is said to have unleashed on culture. According to the standard view, we now live in a homogeneous world, and we show more authenticity in our culture. I agree with the fact that we do employ objects as a means of knowing ourselves. Still, I disagree with the statement that we no longer would be critical of our self-awareness because we do not understand the artefact's creators. In fact, I believe AI could be a tool that enriches our culture and brings the root paradigms and axioms about social life to the forefront of discussions. As seen in history, from the advent of language as a means of professing ways of life to the arrival of the printing press to the birth of the internet, information reaching the masses has caused revolutions that have shaken social order and made the world we live in today. Our polity is still far from perfect, and AI is the correct counterstatement to correct our course. We live in an age of information where we produce much more data than we can humanly consume, so our sociotechnical systems must adapt more to help us filter and process information. I see AI as more of a "second coming" rather than an agent of rupture; it will help us refine religion, destroy hierarchies and help us find spirituality once again. 
Another key feature of the standard view we can argue against is that necessity is the mother of invention. I think AI is more culturally relevant than being universally utilitarian. In a world where we have enough and more people for labour, AI can be seen as a destroyer of jobs. On the other hand, if you take a closer look at the state of things, AI could bring forth economic prosperity that could lead to people finally being able to afford to have time for the "right" things. We are born into a system that dictates that we work on things that have rarely made a difference since the Industrial Age started. I see AI as a cultural need that will change this fundamental paradigm.

## Notes

1. Where AI Thrives, Religion May Struggle
	1. There is a trend that points to the global decline in religious affiliations and identity
	2. A potential factor could be the proliferation of AI and robotics
	3. The more people are exposed to automotive technologies, the weaker their religious beliefs
	4. The connection between science and religion has been pondered for many years
		1. Science contributes to the "disenchantment of the world", replacement of supernatural explanations with rational ones 
	5. Prior research does not support a strong contribution to "disenchantment", but AI and robotics may influence people's beliefs more
	6. Countries with a larger stock of robots saw a decline in religiosity, and countries with less exposure saw a slight uptick
	7. A career with exposure to programming and robots -- a proxy for AI exposure -- saw a fall in likeliness to believe in God 
	8. Several studies have shown a link between automation and religious decline
	9. Historically, religion has been providing ways to solve instrumental problems beyond the scope of human ability by deferring to supernatural agents and religious professionals 
		1. These problems may be more solvable for people living and working in highly automated spaces 
	10. Religion plays a fundamental role in defining morality, but could automation be a suitable substitute for this aspect is questionable as currently, people are unlikely to trust AI with oral decision-making
2. Gods in the machine? The rise of artificial intelligence may result in new religions
	1. Sects that are devoted to the worship of AI could emerge sooner than we think
	2. LLM-powered chatbots have left people awestruck at the same time, terrified, something religion has done before
	3. Generative AI has common characteristics with divine beings, like deities and prophets
		1. Knowledge appears limitless
		2. Capable of great feats of creativity 
		3. It is removed from normal human concerns and needs
		4. It can offer daily life guidelines
		5. It is immortal
	4. Can produce output that can be taken for religious doctrine
	5. AI-based religions will not have a hierarchy 
	6. It could start with one doctrine, but the court diversifies over time because of the number of chatbots   
	7. Could pose risks and could compel followers to do dangerous or destructive things 
	8. Diversity of chatbots could lead to the proliferation of disputes and lead to conflict and disorder 
	9. Regulation is important
	10. Could help reinvent meaning and spirituality
	11. There should be rights for AI worshippers, and AI religions should be given room 
3. How AI could change our relationship with religion
	1. Access to religious texts is limited, some because of language
	2. AI could alter this landscape fundamentally 
	3. There is misinformation and misrepresentation in the context of faith; AI could help or make things worse 
		1. Deepfake images and voice clones could be used to promote propaganda
	4. The Hindu faith outlines four aims 
		1. dharma (righteousness, moral values)
		2. artha (prosperity, economic values) 
		3. kama (pleasure, physiological values)
		4. moksha (spiritual values, self-actualisation)
	5. AI could be a copilot for achieving some of the above
4. The religious mystery of AI
	1. AI could change how people engage with religious texts
	2. Revolutions, like the printing press, had made similar impacts and shook social order
	3. There is a semantic overload of meaning, an overload of different theological interpretations; maybe AI can help
	4. LLMs are developing a frame, a language that is a mere representation of the world that is separate from it 
	5. Because the systems are built on probabilities, it might amplify the loudest traditions
	6. This might be helpful to drive people to the average and reduce polarization 
	7. The creation of things we don't understand means we do not have a language for describing them or talking about them. Even when it comes to sentience and consciousness, we have limited understanding; we move into a realm of mystery, into the realm of religion

## Q and A

Q: In your selected *domain*, browse (popular media) news articles/reports and select at least four. Describe what changes AI is expected to bring to this area. Is there a 'need' that AI will address? What are the hopes and fears/potential positives or negatives discussed? (250 words max)

A: Recent studies have shown that there is a trend that points towards a global decline in religious affiliations and identity.  Prior research does not support a strong contribution of science in influencing people's faith. Still, recent studies indicate that the more people are exposed to automotive technologies, the weaker their beliefs. The proliferation of AI could potentially weaken religious beliefs further. We can see here that there is a cultural need for the "disenchantment of the world", and AI looks like it might just be what we were waiting for. 
For centuries, religion has played a key role in defining morality, but as we discover more complex social dynamics and structures, a mythical entity cannot really be seen as an objective source of truth; human needs have evolved beyond the realm of superstition, and AI is heralding this new truth. However, whether AI can be trusted with ethical decisions or if society would accept this is yet to be determined.
The rise of AI could lead to the formation of new religious sects. After all, AI has many similarities with deities or prophets. Its knowledge appears limitless, and it is capable of great feats of creativity. It is removed from normal human concerns and needs, and the list continues. AI hopes to create religions with no hierarchy and really help people get closer to their Gods. On top of this, living in a world of such a semantic overload of meaning, AI can help with theological interpretation here.

Q: From within these four articles, identify at least two myths of the Standard View of Technology. Using Pfaffenberger's discussion of sociotechnical systems, argue how these myths can be challenged.  (300 words max)

A: LLM-powered chatbots have left people awestruck at the same time, terrified, something religion has managed to do, too, through noble leaders to fanatic preachers. However, it's prevalent that chatbots merely serve a functional use case, as a tool to retrieve information from a source and hand it to the user. According to the Standard View of Technology, "form follows function," one could argue that a chatbot is seen as an artefact whose sole purpose is to be an agent that enables question-answers. It is just a way to increase the Darwinian fitness of the population. Based on Pfaffenberger's discussion, if the sole purpose of an LLM chatbot was to act as a search engine, why then do we work so hard to make it sound so human? There is a cultural meaning behind this, and we have social conditioning where we are more prone to listen to other humans rather than whatever output a machine spits out. It's evident that in these early ages of AI, some people still prefer to chat with humans to resolve issues in a particular domain, even though an AI would probably be able to help them achieve their goals quicker and more efficiently. 
Another myth that we could challenge is "necessity is the mother of invention". Although it might seem like AI and other such automation results from tending to a growing population, if we take a closer look at the situation, we see that automation is doing more harm than good. Consider, for example, the number of jobs it takes away from the economy; it is more of a cultural shift to a capitalist society that is fuelling the proliferation of AI and not necessarily a "necessity".
Another view is that AI could cause a Rupture, but like the birth of the internet or the invention of the printing press, it is merely a new means of how a culture shares its experiences.
