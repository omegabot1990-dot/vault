## Preface

To depict religion as a sociotechnical system, I choose to stick to a single religion, Christianity, to keep the concepts streamlined and coherent. This choice solely depends on the fact that resources about the religion are readily available in English and widely prevalent among avid believers and the general populace, as it has been captured and propagated well through popular media. Most religions share much, so picking one is sufficient to cover most ubiquitous concepts.

## Visualising Religion as a Sociotechnical System

I want to begin with the social structures surrounding Christianity from its inception in the 1st century AD; it has been a pillar of social conformity. In the early ages, when the structure was chaotic, and order was hard to achieve, the promise of a "Messiah" could bring people to believe in rules. In an agrarian society where poverty was prevalent, it must not have been easy for someone in the lower strata of society to survive. Something as simple as treating others as you would want to be treated, a concept even a child could understand these days, would not have been achievable unless the promise of a new world, of a new God, was not established. One could also argue that fear of a new God also caused the uprise against the prevalent authorities. Still, nonetheless, the newfound social structure was a blessing as it paved the way for the common man to live a better life and feel hope in a violent world. 
The hierarchy, which must have been somewhat flat, with a few disciples preaching to the masses, has become a complex machine consisting of tiers of people with varying magnitudes of power in the new world; this is expected for an organisation of such size.
The artefact here is the teachings of the Messiah, whether scriptures in papyrus or mere word-of-mouth or later on the Bible. These artefacts still serve as cues for rituals for people to come together. The followers could reproduce and circulate the teachings, which, in turn, helped coordinate the masses. Even though the Romans scrutinised the propagation, labour could be coordinated just through faith (or fear). The language that emancipated the teachings to be propagated here was specific knowledge about a fair God that people wanted and *needed* to know. 
This caused the rise of the revolutionary movement, which eventually restricted the entire society. Eventually, Constantine the Great converted to Christianity. Something as simple as word of mouth could mean so much for people in power; this is a testament to how this sociotechnical system was used to leverage power and organise labour among the masses.
People coming together on Sundays for mass is a knowledge practice deeply rooted in society from humble beginnings. The Bible and even the practice of consuming the blood and flesh of Christ have become a long-standing ritual that has become somewhat of a social use of these artefacts.

## How can AI make things better?

Christianity has endured the trials of time and remains one of the most prominent ways of living. But as with any organisation of such monumental size, there will have been growing pains associated with it. For a system that holds the key to enormous power, it is natural to have been propagated in some way or form with unfair practices. For example, missionaries were sent across the globe to spread the word of Christ, and at the same time, crusades happened side by side. People were killed, and religion was forced down their throats, but it still managed to bring concepts of ethics and morality to the masses. The system preserved its knowledge by establishing monasteries and later churches. It played a pivotal role in spreading literacy and education. Here, I would like to deviate and bring attention to how AI can play similar roles for the future generation in a time when we seem to be losing cultural values; AI could be what monasteries were in the Middle Ages. It could act as a silo of information about our past and our culture that retains more context about the sociotechnical system it was built on and be an artefact for a new world. What was lacking before was the loss of contextual information. The ability to collate and aggregate large amounts of contextual data that pertain to how and why the system works in a certain way has been lost in the past. Still, now we have the unique ability to accumulate how, why, where, when, and the context of why something is deemed ethical or moral.
This brings attention back to religion and how it has grown over the ages as something that might have started with negligible hierarchy but has been used over the years as a tool to establish power. Any system would be forced to self-organise itself as a complex hierarchical model, as we have seen through history and what we now know as the establishments of the church. Let's take a step back for a moment; religion was something that gave people hope, whether it be through faith or fear of the unknown; it gave people meaning, and it gave people a sense of love and belonging, which is crucial for us humans as we can from Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It has become so tedious to reach one's God nowadays; in simple terms, too many cooks have spoiled the broth. The need for hierarchy has defeated its purpose; I want to highlight how AI can improve this. AI could act as a priest would, but without the politics that bind priests, it could be a way to understand scriptures better and be a hyper-personalised way to find one's own way to God. It could remove the biases and the segregation among sects; it could truly act as a way to unify humans under the same umbrella and may even help us see what religion truly holds: a path to love and belonging, a path to safety and security and who knows, maybe even self-actualisation.

## Q and A

Q: Visualise and/or describe the elements of the system and explain how they are connected (Max 400 words)
A: The social structure surrounding Christianity is quite complex; it has undergone many changes over the ages. However, I want to highlight pivotal workers and labourers who have stood the test of time. The bishops, priests and the religious clergy played a central role in the social structure. They were the leaders and essential agents who were in charge of overall coordination and on top of the hierarchy. They were the ones with real power and were portrayed in an ideal way as the messengers of God. Support of the monarchy, plus the role of the sacred text (the Bible), made it somewhat of a legal arrangement that restructured power.
The next and maybe one of the most important groups consists of the monks, monastic workers, scribes and scholars. The scribes, later replaced by the printing press, were paramount in education and the proliferation of knowledge. They made it possible to spread information. On the other hand, the scholars and monks helped teach new clergy and preserve knowledge, respectively. This enabled the system to run smoothly and continue to grow; the priests were empowered by knowledge and education that came in association. 
In order to retain power, you need to be able to showcase it, and the incredible churches and cathedrals with astonishing artwork helped to do just this. The builders and artisans were often commissioned by the church, and they, in turn, helped the church display great feats of prowess and restructure the space. I would like to bring our attention to the common folk and the tax collectors, without which none of this social structure would have come to be. On top of their hard work, this huge organisation came into existence. We can now see a sort of cycling movement of money and how it, in turn, created jobs like scribes and tax collectors. This merely oversimplifies something much more complex with merchants, mercenaries, farmers, physicians and many more workers.
Now, I move on to four artefacts. The sacred text (the Bible) is the foundational text of Christian doctrine; the social glue keeps the community together more than a reservoir of knowledge. The holy cross serves as a form of public identity. The bread and wine symbolise Christ's body and blood, which, in turn, serves as a ritualistic cue to join communion on Sundays, which is a knowledge practice. As we can see, these artefacts play a bigger role in social cases than function. We can also see some sects participating in group chants and dancing, which is an example of language use and movements and gestures, respectively.

Q: Depending on your starting position for the sociotechnical system, reflect on either a) how this system would need to change if (particular) AI tools would not work anymore // imagine it without AI; OR b) what changes with introducing (particular) AI tools in it. (Max 500 words)
