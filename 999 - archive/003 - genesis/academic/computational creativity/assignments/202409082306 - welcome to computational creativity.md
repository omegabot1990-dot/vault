## Online Creativity Test

Test Site: http://www.testmycreativity.com/

I scored 77.44 on the creativity test. I scored about 15 points more than a typical test taker (62.62). Is that good enough, or should I be concerned? I scored the highest on curiosity, which I believe is one of the easiest things to guess about me, but I scored the lowest on complexity; the website defines complexity as the ability to hold a large amount of information and manage and find relationships between them; as a masters student, this assessment was a little alarming. 

The first thing I noticed was that the test only had 40 questions; honestly, I don't believe a mere 40 questions (multiple-choice) is good enough to gauge the creativity of any individual, person or machine. The minute I started the quiz, my confidence in it dropped. The test started with questions about my age, nationality, education, work experience, etc., which seemed irrelevant to determining my creativity. The first 1/8th of the test was sadly disappointing and felt more like a way to collect my information for ad agencies rather than being part of any real assessment. The next part of the quiz seemed more promising; questions became more open, and you had to answer on a scale of 1-10, which made more sense for such a quiz. Some of the questions made me think for a second. I am a person who likes change but also likes to be thorough with what I do, but seeing the two questions made me doubt how I should answer them. Was I being honest? or was I trying to find the right answer that I had somehow picked up from my interactions with "society"? 

I realised that I question myself more binary when I introspect; I contextualise each question in its boundary and rarely let the boundaries overlap. The quiz had suddenly gotten far more interesting. Some questions, such as "Do you like to work on one thing at a time?" were very easy and relatable, but others, like "Do you laugh more than most people?" made me wonder if there was a deeper underlying psychological aspect to the whole test. The more questions I attempted, the contradictions I found in my answers, and the more it made me think about my mental constructs. As someone who does not believe rules work out all the time but also would resort to logic rather than gut feeling, I felt like the questions were mixing different planes of my psyche, which excited me.

I decided to take it one question at a time; the more I mixed contexts, the harder it became to answer. This made the next half of the test much easier to answer but still challenging to an extent. Some of the questions were so generic it was very hard to answer in a "right" way. "Do others come to you for advice regularly?" yes and no, for most people who live in a million different universes, interacting with so many different people; what universe do I pick to answer this?

The test got more interesting as I got to the end of the test; the last 1/8th of the test, where I had to connect two words, was super confusing for me. Should I let my imagination loose? or should I find logical connections for them all? Then came the "What do you see in this picture?" questions; this is when I thought I should go crazy. The questions then became weirder and holistically open-ended, and I couldn't quite find a way to answer them any more than rely on my "gut feeling", which, in my honest opinion, I never do. 

30 minutes later, I was finally done. Something I thought would be mundane and useless was more exciting than I had imagined. Even though I have seen such questions in so many places and often asked myself these questions so many times, seeing them and answering them in various contexts made me think about what makes me "me". I often considered myself moderately creative; noodling the guitar is one of my favourite hobbies, and it made me feel pretty good. I always thought that the whole feeling was because I was being "creative" in my own way, and the "creativity" was fuelling how good I felt, but the test made me question so many things that I have started wondering, what exactly is creativity to me?
