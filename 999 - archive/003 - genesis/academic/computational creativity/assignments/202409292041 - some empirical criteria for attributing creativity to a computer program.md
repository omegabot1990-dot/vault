#### How to determine when a program creates a novel Experimental Rock music melody

Rock music is indeed an umbrella term for a very vast genre. There are many sub-genres, such as indie rock, hard rock, experimental rock, etc. I want to focus on the lead part on the guitar. Novelty in such a space is very hard to define, but rethinking such a space in terms of typicality and value instead of the perceived value of an audience without training makes more logical sense. 
Consider a hybrid approach with two artefact classes $B_{1}$ and $B_2$, one for the broader umbrella term "Rock" and the other for a more finely refined curation of "Experimental Rock", both with its own respective value based artefact classes. Criteria one for average typicality should hold true for both cases. But if you take criteria two, $ratio(T_{\alpha, 1}(R), R) > \theta$, if we were to take the results from $B_2$ as $R_2$ and calculate the conformance ratio, then defining a lower $\theta_{1}$ and keeping a higher $\theta_{2}$ we would be able to estimate how creative the sub-genre is and how novel the generated result is from a more global standpoint but with a defined methodology. Here we can also take use of criteria three and four too and make sure both are high.
