## Notes

* Heterogeneity across various domains makes it difficult to formalise a definition of *creativity*
* Computational Creativity (CC) takes an explicitly algorithmic perspective on creativity
	* Specific processes
	* Algorithms 
	* Knowledge structures
* Newell, Shaw, Simon (1963), criteria for categorisation as "creative"
	* The answer has novelty and usefulness (for the individual or society)
	* The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted
	* The answer results from intense motivation and persistence
	* The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague
* Methods employed by CC researchers
	* They ignore the need to define the phenomenon objectively; they may employ an ad-hoc definition for connivance 
		* Allows practical work to continue
		* Which may eventually lead to a fuller and more satisfying definition
	* They embrace the metaphorical foundation of creativity to identify processes and mechanisms within our repertoire of computational algorithms and representations that best embody these folk metaphors
	* They identify an archetypal area of creative endeavour and attempt to model that area computationally
* The goal of CC is for machines to exhibit human-level creativity that humans will also perceive as "creative."
	* Can be used to illuminate the processes and biases of human creativity 
* The generation of outputs must be coupled with an awareness of its value in terms of its novelty and utility
	* A creative computer must be able to justify its outputs much as a human creator would do
	* Must be able to articulate why its outputs may have interesting and unexpected value for its audience
* Investment Theory (Sternberg and Lubart, 1995, 1996)
	* A creative computer must be able to articulate its sense of how a particular product or idea can be "bought low and sold high"
* Humans still believe creativity is biological; even if a computer exhibits some measure of creativity, the credit is given to the programmer (creator); this is called *pastiche*[^1] in CC
	* These systems take no risks, always produce well-formatted outputs, and have no need to self-critique or ever learn from their failures
* Pastiche serves as a boundary case in CC, the goal of CC is to transcend pastiche actively
* CC views creativity as arising from more than a merely systematic search of a conceptual space of possibilities; it recognises that these spaces are deeply rutted with conventional pathways and that creativity arises from how an intelligent agent knowingly exploits or subverts these conventions
	* Boden (1990) suggests ways in which creativity might arise from the exploration of such a space
		* Adaptive creativity is viewed as not only being able to deliver surprising solutions but that also changes the way we view the problem itself
		* He says we should explore *exploratory creativity* (explores the space as defined by the problem, looking for states of high value) and *transformational creativity* (actively transforms the space)
		* In cases when the best path to a solution is circuitous[^2] and non-obvious, mental agility is not a matter of agility but of sure-footedness
	* G. Wiggins (2006) formalised the CC components of this perspective
* Alternate metaphors for creative choice-making may be reducible to the nondeterministic exploration of an abstract space
* Minsky (1980)
	* Jokes subvert the logic of intelligent search in a state space and thereby demonstrate the limits of conventionalised thought processes 
* It is on the computational treatment of discontinuity, incongruity and contradiction that CC most distinguishes itself from AI as a discipline
* Theory of *Bisociation*[^3], Koestler (1964)
	* The creativity of these diverse phenomena emerges from the collision of two seemingly incompatible frames of reference
	* The basis for Fauconnier and Turner's influential theory of *Conceptual Blending*
* PROSECCO - Promote the Scientific Exploration of Computational Creativity
* PROSECCO Vision
	* Machines can be more than mere tools but can actually rise to the level of co-creators
	* Envisions a largely autonomous agent that explores its own conceptual space and expresses its own ideas in its own terms
	* Two guises,
		* Autonomous systems that receive little to no human input
		* Semi-autonomous hybrid systems that interact with humans as peers
		* The goal is not to replace human creativity but to engage and foster human creativity as only a creative equal can
	* Two large-scale semantic resources 
		* NOC list - Non-Official Characterisation list
			* Provides semantic details on a large caste of famous personalities (800+)
	* Scéalextric knowledge base
		* Plot structures and idiomatic renderings for story actions
	* Themes of Creativity
		* Novelty
			* Kazjon Grace and Mary Lou Maher argue that an artefact is novel to the extent that it violates our expectations of "more of the same"
			* Expectations can crucially shape the generation process
		* Anna Jordanous takes a look at the issue of evaluation, considering the issue from a historical, strategic and methodical perspective
			* CC should be able to provide a sound and systematic basis for the rigorous evaluation of our automated systems
		* Graeme Ritchie (2017) argues that comparable growth must match growth in the engineering sophistication of CC systems in the objective rigour and sophistication of our methods for evaluating these systems
			* Uses an analysis of past evaluations to establish a solid foundation for the evaluation of future CC systems
		* Lorenzo Gatti, Gözde Ozbal, Marco Guerini, Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava explore linguistic creativity as it inheres in puns and advertising slogans (Gatti et al., 2017)
		* Rafael Pérez y Pérez provided a model storytelling system (MEXICA) that aims to capture how real people tell stories in social situations
			* Stories hinge on how others both obey and subvert social expectations, so Pérez y Pérez sets out in this chapter to capture the kinds of common-sense knowledge that influence our understanding of social norms and those who obey, bend or break them
		* Pablo Gervás is known for poetry generation as well as for story generation
		* Rob Saunders, in his contribution to this volume, uses a multi-agent framework to explore how those social conventions might arise in the first place
			* Creativity is not a quality of a lone system but of a social agent interacting in a dynamic world
		* Jon McCormack concerns himself with how ideas of a “biological” creativity can guide and inspire – via appropriate acts of abstraction, simplification and generalisation – work in computational creativity (McCormack, 2017)
		* Geraint Wiggins’s work deals with abstraction and generalisation
		* Dan Ventura considers the related questions of system intentionality and system autonomy, both at a philosophical level and at a practical level afforded by his CC system DARCI (Ventura, 2017)
		* Tony Veale explores the phenomenon of conceptual blending (Veale, 2017), but finds it too powerful and too operationally vague to be properly and faithfully implemented by any real CC system
			* He identifies a subspecies of conceptual blend that is more amenable to robust computational modelling, coining the term “conceptual mash-up” to distinguish this related notion from its complex forebear
		* Taking a historical perspective on the development and subsequent revision of an early CC implementation of conceptual blending – named *Divago* – the authors Pedro Martins and Francisco C. Pereira and Amilcar Cardoso show how those early systems can provide a sound foundation for building a robust modern approach to the most challenging aspects of human creative behaviour
		* Nada Lavrač, Matjaz Juršič, Borut Sluban, Matic Perovšek, Senja Pollak, Tanja Urbančič and Bojan Cestnik focus on scientific knowledge discovery at the overlap of domains that are constituted by different textual subsets of the scientific literature
		* Ashok Goel deals with the design domain; he applies model-based analogy to the solution of creative problems in design, showing how past engineering solutions can be retrieved and adapted to suit new needs in new contexts

## Summary

Computational Creativity (CC) is an explicitly algorithmic perspective on creativity that aims to develop machines that exhibit human-level creativity. CC researchers ignore the need to define creativity objectively and instead focus on identifying processes and mechanisms within computational algorithms and representations that best embody folk metaphors of creativity. The goal of CC is for machines to generate novel, useful, and justifiable outputs, much like a human creator would do.

CC views creativity as arising from more than a systematic search of possibilities, recognising that conventional pathways exist in conceptual spaces. It explores two types of creative choice-making: exploratory creativity (exploring the space) and transformational creativity (actively transforming the space).

The text also discusses various creativity-related themes, including novelty, evaluation, linguistic creativity, storytelling, poetry generation, and system intentionality. It highlights the importance of abstraction, generalisation, and simplification in computational creativity.

Overall, CC aims to develop machines that can co-create with humans, fostering human creativity as only a creative equal can.
