| Color      | What you highlight                                      | Example                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Green**  | Formal definitions, math, exact formulations            | Softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ)                                                           |
| **Yellow** | Mechanistic explanations (how it works)                 | Self-attention lets each token context-condition on all others               |
| **Red**    | Conceptual framings/intuitions (why design is this way) | Positional embeddings inject order into a permutation-invariant architecture |

If a sentence is not one of these, **no highlight**.

For each highlight, in the margin, write a maximum of six words answering this:

> “What problem does this solve?”

Examples to write on the side:

- “makes parallelism possible”
    
- “avoid O(n²) cost”
    
- “keeps positional info”
    
- “enables long-range dependency”
    
- “fuse representation + attention weights”
    

Margin notes are mandatory.  
Otherwise, the highlight is useless.

## Reading cycle

**First pass:** read normally → no highlighting.  
**Second pass:** apply three colours + margin notes.  
**Third pass:** immediately do 2–3 flashcards.

## Your 2-sentence summary after each section

Write this _at the end of each subheading_:

1. **Before** reading this subsection, how did you think the model worked?
    
2. **After** this subsection, what changed in your mental model?
    

Example:

> Before: I thought attention was just weighting tokens.  
> After: I now see the Q/K dot product is a similarity measure that builds an alignment matrix.

**This is the single most powerful learning reinforcement you can do.**
