- **Dialogue**: EmpatheticDialogues, DailyDialog++ (filtered for non-clinical use), synthetic journaling turns.
    
- **Reasoning Supervision**: synthetic _plans/checklists_ (e.g., “journal scaffold → identify thought → reframe → action”).
    
- **Emotion/State**: GoEmotions (mapped to your taxonomy), custom annotations from psychology students (small but high-quality).
    
- **RAG**: Licensed/allowlisted psychoeducational content, CBT/DBT worksheets, burnout/perfectionism articles; multilingual where possible.
