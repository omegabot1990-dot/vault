## Intellectual Synergy

#### Why

- **Head of the _Affective Computing and Human–Robot Interaction Lab_**, where research integrates psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence to study how emotions can be computationally represented, modelled, and expressed in intelligent systems.  
	
	- Work bridges **theoretical emotion models** (like cognitive appraisal theories) with **practical AI design** for socially intelligent agents and robots.
	    
- Focuses on **computational modelling of emotions**, **emotion psychology**, **human–agent interaction**, and **explainable emotional AI**.
	
	- Directly map onto the idea of developing an **emotionally intelligent assistant** capable of understanding user context, journaling insights, and offering empathic, non-clinical emotional support.
	    
- The proposed assistant — a **psychologically aware, context-adaptive system** that combines journaling, reflection, and AI-driven empathy — resonates deeply with the lab’s mission to create agents that **reason about emotional states**, adapt their responses based on affective cues, and maintain **transparency in emotional reasoning**.
    
- Past work and interdisciplinary collaborations show a clear emphasis on connecting **emotion psychology with computational models** — through workshops and joint projects exploring **how AI systems can interpret, simulate, and ethically communicate emotions**.  
    
	- This aligns precisely to embed **psychological validity** and **explainability** into an AI that helps users understand and manage their emotional states safely and effectively.
	    
- **Potential intersection:**
    
    - Applying **cognitive appraisal models** to interpret journaling content and mood trends.
        
        - Cognitive Appraisal Theory suggests that emotions stem from how we interpret situations, rather than from the situations themselves.
            
    - Using **reinforcement learning–based emotional modelling** to guide adaptive feedback loops in journaling.
        
    - Ensuring **explainable emotional reasoning** (why a system inferred a particular emotion or insight).
        
    - Exploring **human–agent trust, empathy calibration, and ethical affective design** for long-term engagement.
        
- **Keywords:** Affective computing, computational modelling of emotion, emotion psychology, empathy in AI, explainable affective reasoning, human–agent interaction, emotion-driven reinforcement learning.
    
- **Best fit for:** The **psychological reasoning**, **emotion classification**, and **explainability framework** of your LLM-based emotional journaling assistant — especially the modules focusing on **affect recognition**, **emotional feedback modelling, and human-centred validation**.
    

## Research Interests

### 🧠 **Computational Modelling of Emotions in Reinforcement Learning**

- Uses **RL frameworks** (reward–punishment learning) to simulate how emotions influence **decision-making and adaptation**.
    
- Models emotional states (e.g., frustration, joy) as **internal reward signals** that guide exploration or policy shifts.
    
- Helps design agents that **learn like humans**—balancing rational goals with affective responses.

### 💭 **Computational Models of Cognitive Appraisal**

- Based on **appraisal theory**, emotions arise from how a person **evaluates events** relative to their goals or beliefs.
    
- Computational models simulate this by mapping **stimulus → appraisal → emotion → behaviour**.
    
- Useful for building AI that can **reason about emotional triggers**, not just react to expressions.

### 🧩 **Emotion Psychology**

- The scientific study of how emotions are **generated, expressed, and regulated** in humans.
    
- Provides theoretical foundations (like **Ekman’s basic emotions**, **Russell’s circumplex model**, or **Lazarus’s appraisal model**) for computational emotion models.
    
- Links subjective feeling with **neural, behavioural, and physiological** processes.

### 🎮 **Emotions in Computer Games**

- Studies how games **evoke, represent, or adapt to player emotions**.
    
- Includes dynamic difficulty adjustment, adaptive storytelling, and player modelling based on emotional states.
    
- Used to improve **engagement, immersion, and emotional realism** in game design.

### 🔍 **Explainability and Transparency of AI**

- Focuses on making AI decisions **understandable to humans**—especially when models use emotion-based reasoning.
    
- Enables users to **trust and interpret** why an AI agent responded with certain emotional or empathetic cues.
    
- Involves **interpretable models, saliency maps, and natural-language explanations**.

### 👁️ **Human Perception and Effects of Emotions Expressed by Virtual Agents and Robots**

- Studies how people **interpret and react** to emotions shown by AI agents or robots (facial expressions, tone, gestures).
    
- Aims to ensure emotional expressions are **believable, context-appropriate, and culturally sensitive**.
    
- Critical for **social robots**, therapy bots, and educational companions.
    

---

### 🧾 **Emotional and Affective Self-Report**

- Involves **collecting subjective emotion data** from users via surveys, scales, or journaling (e.g., PANAS, SAM, VAD ratings).
    
- Used to **validate computational models** or train emotion classifiers.
    
- Bridges the gap between **physiological signals and felt emotions**.

### 🤖 **Human-Robot and Human-Agent Interaction**

- Examines how humans **communicate, cooperate, and build rapport** with robots or virtual agents.
    
- Integrates **social, emotional, and cognitive modelling** to create natural, empathetic interaction patterns.
    
- Key for domains like **therapy, education, and customer support**.
    

---

### 🎓 **Educational Humanoid Robots**

- Robots designed to **teach, tutor, or support learning** often have expressive faces or gestures.
    
- Use emotion modelling to **recognise student engagement** and **adapt teaching style** dynamically.
    
- Blend **AI, psychology, and pedagogy** to create emotionally intelligent learning companions.
