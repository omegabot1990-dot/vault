### 🧩 **Conceptual Context**

**Multimodal emotion modelling** integrates:

- 🗣 **Text** → linguistic features (sentiment, semantic framing, emotion lexicons)
    
- 🎙 **Voice** → prosody, tone, pitch, pauses, intensity
    
- 💓 **Bio-signals** → heart rate variability, EDA (electrodermal activity), facial EMG, respiration, EEG
    

Together, these signals enable the model to infer both cognitive appraisal and physiological arousal, which is essential for human-centric affective reasoning and empathy modelling.

### 💡 **Possible Research Question Directions**

#### **1. Core Research Question**

> How can multimodal fusion of text, voice, and bio-signals enhance emotion classification accuracy while maintaining interpretability and user trust in human-centric AI systems?

---

#### **2. Evaluation-Oriented Question (like your example)**

> What evaluation rubric best captures **empathy, reasoning quality, and safety** in multimodal emotion understanding models that integrate linguistic, vocal, and physiological data?

---

#### **3. Human–AI Interaction Focus**

> How can multimodal emotion recognition models adapt in real time to a user’s affective state while preserving **privacy, autonomy, and psychological safety**?

---

#### **4. Explainability & Validation**

> What forms of **explainable reasoning** (e.g., attention heatmaps, physiological feedback visualisation) improve user **trust and emotional resonance** in multimodal affective AI systems?

---

#### **5. Psychological Grounding**

> Can multimodal emotion models using bio-signals approximate constructs from **emotion psychology** (e.g., valence–arousal, cognitive appraisal) more reliably than unimodal systems?
