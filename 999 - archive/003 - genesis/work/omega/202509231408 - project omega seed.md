## Problem (2)

- Lack of awareness about mental health
- Psychologist/Psychiatrist  
	- Cost of services
	- Availability issues
	- Length of session (1hr)
		- Maybe too short
	- No continuous support
- ==Hyper-personalised help==
- Lack of community support
	- Anonymised or otherwise
- 24/7 availability not available
- Stigma around mental health
- ==Lack of multi-language support (not hyper-localised)==
- Lack of voice-based assistance
- ==Lack of context== 
	- ==Cultural==
- Fragmented ecosystem
	- Users have to jump between meditation apps, journaling tools, therapy, and community groups
- Low adherence
	- Even when people try apps, drop-off is high (they lose motivation)
- Scalability of human therapists
	- Even if people want therapy, there aren’t enough trained professionals (especially in India, the ratio is ~1 therapist per 100,000 people)
- Insurance gaps
	- Mental health is rarely covered under health insurance in India.
- Interoperability issue
	- No unified record between the therapist, digital tools, and the patient

#### AI-Based Assistance

- Data issue
	- Quality of data
	- Availability of data
	- Structured approach vetted by a psychologist/psychiatrist
	- TODO - ==Do R&D==
		- Find people in the domain to collaborate with
- LLM 
	- Cost
		- One ChatGPT query leaves a carbon footprint similar to that of a microwave for a month
	- ==World models (too much information)==
	- Data privacy
	- Data leak
- Environmental damages
	- Carbon footprint

### Existing Alternatives
