## Daily Review 
#### Goals
* **Review Today's Progress**:
    - Assess the completion status of today's planned tasks. Ensure that all tasks are updated with their current progress.
- **Plan for Tomorrow**:
    - Review the plan and allocate tasks for tomorrow. Adjust the schedule as needed based on today's achievements and any remaining workload.
- **Allocate Time Slots and Schedule Tasks**:
    - Assign specific time slots to each task for the next day.
    - Create calendar events for each task and set reminders to maintain focus and ensure timely completion.
- **Identify Issues**:
    - Document any challenges or problems encountered today. Analyse the root causes and consider potential solutions.
- **Incorporate New Information**:
    - Review any new information received today. If relevant, create tasks and incorporate them into the upcoming days or backlog.
- **Update Daily Habits**:
	- Add the [[snippet - daily habits]] list and update the daily habits. Ensure that necessary habits are checked off as completed at the end of the day.

## Planning 
#### Goals
- **Consolidate Spillover Tasks**:
    - Review all tasks that were not completed in the previous sprint. Add these to your current sprint's "To Do" list.
- **Incorporate New Tasks from the Backlog**:
    - Examine your backlog and select new items to add to the "To Do" section. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritise tasks based on urgency and importance, and consider the story point estimates to gauge task complexity.
- **Define the Sprint Scope**:
    - Clearly articulate the objectives and deliverables for the sprint.
- **Distribute Tasks Across Sprint Days**:
    - Allocate each task to a specific day within the sprint, balancing the workload to avoid bottlenecks.
## Grooming
#### Goals
* **Break Down Complex Tasks**:
    - Identify tasks that are too large or complex to manage effectively. Divide these into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
- **Create New Subtasks**:
    - Clearly define each subtask, ensuring that each one is actionable and specific. Assign a clear objective or outcome to every subtask.
- **Estimate Task Complexity**:
    - Assess the complexity of each new subtask. Use appropriate estimation techniques (like story points) to gauge the effort and resources required.
- **Prioritise Subtasks**:
	- Reevaluate and adjust the priorities of each subtask in the backlog, taking into account any new information or changes in project conditions. 

## Retrospective
#### Goals
* **Review Completed Tasks**:
    - Thoroughly review all tasks marked as "Done" to ensure they have been completed satisfactorily.
- **Clear the 'In Review' Section**:
    - Verify that nothing remains in the "In Review" section. Ensure all tasks have been either moved to "Done" or returned for further work.
- **Identify Spillover Tasks**:
    - List all tasks that were not completed in the current sprint, noting them as spillover tasks for consideration in the next planning session.
- **Calculate Velocity**:
    - Determine the sprint velocity by calculating the ratio of completed points to planned points. 
- **Evaluate Performance**:
    - Reflect on the sprint to identify what went well and areas for improvement. Evaluate if any specific process improvements are needed.
- **Define Action Items**:
    - Based on the review, outline actionable steps to enhance productivity for future sprints.
