Throughout the course so far, you have been learning about different lines of critique regarding AI development (e.g., critique regarding the hyped expectations of what AI can/will do, unaccounted large environmental costs, unfair/invisible labour practices, concentration of corporate power, problematic training data and models, increasing inequality, ethics-washing, and so on).

Decide on one such (but not limited to what's been discussed in the class) concern/critique regarding how AI is being developed right now, which you think is relevant within your domain. Using no less than four sources to substantiate your points, write an essay (total max 1,000 words) where you:

1. Explain what the critique is and what problem it addresses.
2. Explain the relevance of the problem and the critique in your domain and why you find it important/why it resonates with you.
3. Describe who champions this critique – where it is coming from, are there particular groups leading it, have some significant moments/examples are used to illustrate the problem, is there a specific moment in time around when this critique became more visible or maybe it is still rather unknown?
4. What is the goal of the critique – what does it want to achieve?
5. Reason about the problem and its context as well—why is the problem identified as a problem? What contexts and values/norms are at stake? Without concerns about climate change, energy consumption wouldn’t seem such an issue, and without the belief in equality and fairness, we wouldn’t worry about biased systems.

Remember that this assignment can be a substantial part of your final assignment, where you will re-imagine AI, so you can think about an issue you want to address later by providing an alternative view in the final assignment. At this point, focus only on exploring this critique and the issue(s) that it addresses. 

You can write it as an essay without separating the questions if that suits you better.
