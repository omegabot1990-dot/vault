**Subject:** Thesis Proposal: Human-Centric Affective AI for Edge-Based Emotion Reasoning | Developing Human-Centric Affective Models for Privacy-Preserving Emotion Reasoning

Dear Prof. Broekens,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Gaurisankar Jayadas, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence (Human-Centric AI stream) at Leiden University. I am in my first semester of the second year and seeking a thesis supervisor. 

I am reaching out to propose an initial idea for my Master’s thesis that focuses on affective computing, explainable AI, and sustainable edge intelligence. These topics are closely related to your research on computational models of emotion and human-robot interaction.

My concept aims to develop a small, reasoning-based affective model that can support psychoeducation, journaling, and emotion exploration without crossing into diagnostic territory. Unlike large, opaque LLMs commonly used in mental-health chat agents, this model would:

- Exhibit structured, auditable reasoning using an internal scratchpad and a verifier module.
- Run efficiently on edge or federated setups, supporting privacy and sustainability.
- Undergo human-centric validation, emphasising emotional grounding, explainability, and ethical design.

This is a step toward developing emotionally intelligent systems that combine psychology-oriented NLP, lightweight architectures, and affect-based reasoning in a transparent, privacy-preserving manner.

Given your extensive work in computational emotion modelling, reinforcement learning as a model of appraisal, and affective HRI (Human-Robot Interaction), your guidance would be invaluable in shaping this into a robust and ethically grounded thesis.

Can we schedule a short meeting to discuss the feasibility and direction of this idea? I would greatly appreciate your feedback or any suggestions you might have.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Dear Prof. Broekens,

Thank you for your message. That sounds excellent, and I would like to learn more about the related project you mentioned. I have already explored some market gaps for this project, and I'm eager to discuss those with you as well. I am collaborating with a master's student in psychology at Leiden University (psychology) and a peer working in product strategy in Berlin. I have attached a document with a recent competitor study we conducted https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_r7YR6Mp3PK9PN2Wc4RIbz2SASJu-rOJLNFYkeBIV_M/edit?usp=sharing.

I had a full day of lectures today, but I’m available tomorrow anytime after 1 PM. Please let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Warm regards,

Dear Prof. Broekens,

Just a quick follow-up regarding our meeting. I’m available today after 13:00 for the rest of the afternoon/evening, and any time tomorrow.  
Would any of these windows work for you?

Please let me know a time and location that would be convenient for you. I can come by your office or wherever you prefer.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,

## Suzan Verberne

**Subject:** Thesis Proposal: Efficient and Explainable Affective Reasoning Models for Human-Centric NLP

Dear Prof. Verberne,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Gaurisankar Jayadas, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence (Human-Centric AI stream) at Leiden University. I am in my first semester of the second year and seeking a thesis supervisor. 

I am reaching out to suggest an initial thesis idea that aligns with your work on efficient, source-aware, and factually grounded NLP models. My concept involves creating a small reasoning-based affective model designed for psychoeducation, journaling, and emotion exploration. It functions as a supportive tool rather than a diagnostic system.

Unlike current large-scale, opaque LLMs often used in mental-health chat agents, this model would:

- Demonstrate verifiable reasoning using an internal scratchpad and verifier mechanism, ensuring transparency.
- Operate efficiently on edge or federated systems, minimising carbon footprint and supporting privacy-preserving deployment.
- Incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure factual accuracy while preventing hallucination and bias.

The aim is to investigate how smaller, interpretable LLMs can reason about affect and language in a manner that is efficient, ethically aligned, and trustworthy; these topics closely resonate with your research on factual accuracy, bias mitigation, and efficient language modelling.

Can we schedule a short meeting to discuss the feasibility and direction of this idea? I would greatly appreciate your feedback or any suggestions you might have.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Dear Prof. Verberne,

Thank you for your response and for pointing me toward Dr. Plaza del Arco and Prof. Broekens. I’ll reach out to them regarding supervision.

I really appreciate your advice. If possible, I would love to meet you later in the process, once my thesis is more developed and I’m working on concrete problems related to your research in NLP and factual grounding.

Thank you again for your time and guidance.

**Subject:** Thesis Proposal: Responsible and Explainable Affective Reasoning Models for Human-AI Interaction

Dear Dr. Plaza del Arco,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Gaurisankar Jayadas, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence (Human-Centric AI stream) at Leiden University. I am currently in the first semester of my second year and seeking a thesis supervisor.

I am reaching out to share an initial thesis idea that aligns closely with your research at the intersection of language, computation, and society, particularly in responsible and explainable Human-AI interaction.

My concept involves creating a small reasoning-based affective model designed for psychoeducation, journaling, and emotion exploration. It functions as a supportive tool rather than a diagnostic system.

Unlike current large-scale, opaque LLMs often used in mental-health chat agents, this model would:

- Demonstrate verifiable reasoning using an internal scratchpad and verifier mechanism, ensuring transparency.
- Operate efficiently on edge or federated systems, minimising carbon footprint and supporting privacy-preserving deployment.
- Incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure factual accuracy while preventing hallucination and bias.

The goal is to explore how smaller, interpretable language models can reason responsibly about affect and emotion, combining explainability, cultural awareness, and ethical design in Human-AI interaction. I believe this connects well with your ongoing work on emotion and bias in language models and NLP for social good.

Would it be possible to schedule a short meeting to discuss the feasibility and potential direction of this idea under your supervision? I would appreciate your feedback and any guidance you could share.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
