For this assignment, you must submit your version of a socio-technical system of your selected domain. Try to zoom in on the specific practice areas you are interested in. Use [these questions about relevant elements](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/content/enforced/331545-4343AISOCY_2425_S1/SociotechnicalSystem_mindmap_questions.pdf?ou=331545) based on Pfaffenberger's article for inspiration and guidance.

- In your depiction, indicate at least eight types of labour/workers central to this domain. How is the labour coordinated? What social hierarchies and power relations characterise this area?
- Indicate at least four different ‘artefacts’ and describe at least two other ‘social uses of these artefacts’.
- Indicate at least 1 example for each of these - ‘knowledge practices’, ‘language use’, ‘restructuring of space’, ‘movements and gestures’.   

You can use the collectively started map (and elaborate uniquely). 

1) Visualise and/or describe the elements of the system and explain how they are connected (Max 400 words)

2) Depending on your starting position for the sociotechnical system, reflect on either a) how this system would need to change if (particular) AI tools would not work anymore // imagine it without AI; OR b) what changes with introducing (particular) AI tools in it. (Max 500 words)

Use references where applicable.
