## Motivation Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the **DAREdevil Intern position** within ABN AMRO’s Data Analytics Reliability Engineering (DARE) team. The opportunity to contribute to a group that ensures resilient, scalable, and reliable AI infrastructure strongly resonates with both my academic path in Artificial Intelligence and my professional experience in finance and technology startups.

My career began at Woven Money, where I worked on innovative finance-tech solutions that balanced data analytics, user experience, and reliability by building robust algorithms and systems. This experience enabled me to establish a solid foundation in developing scalable platforms while navigating the challenges of a startup environment.

Previously, at Marketfeed (Y Combinator '21), a fintech startup, I worked closely with trading systems and developed data-driven financial solutions. This role provided me with firsthand exposure to the fast-paced world of financial markets and the importance of reliable platforms where uptime and accuracy are crucial.

Both experiences taught me to thrive in environments where experimentation, agility, and problem-solving are essential; values I see mirrored in ABN AMRO’s DARE team.

Currently, as a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Leiden University, I am specialising in building intelligent systems that not only deliver performance but can also endure real-world challenges. I am particularly motivated by ABN AMRO’s mission to create resilient AI infrastructure, as it aligns with my passion for combining AI with robust engineering practices. The chance to learn from professionals who have mastered incident response, while contributing my own technical skills and entrepreneurial mindset, excites me greatly.

What sets me apart is my blend of startup grit and academic rigor:
- Experience in data-driven finance and analytics at Woven Money and Marketfeed.
- Strong foundation in AI, reliability engineering, and system design from my current Master’s program.
- A collaborative, curious, and hands-on approach to tackling technical challenges.
    
My background and motivation make me a strong fit for this role. I am eager to bring my energy, creativity, and technical expertise to the DARE team while gaining invaluable experience in shaping the future of resilient AI systems at ABN AMRO.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further how I can contribute as a DAREdevil Intern.

Sincerely,  
Gaurisankar Jayadas

## Screening Call

Q: What three words would you use to describe yourself?
A: Curious, Perfectionist, Adventurous

- **Curious**  
    Perfect fit. DARE values people who dig deep into systems, ask questions, and learn by breaking and fixing things. Shows you’re eager to explore.
- **Perfectionist** 
    Mixed signal. It suggests high standards (good for reliability engineering), but can also sound rigid or slow in a team that values agility and experimentation. If asked, you’ll want to frame it as: _“I hold myself to high standards, but I also know when to deliver iteratively and improve along the way.”_
- **Adventurous**   
    Very fitting with the **DAREdevil** branding. It signals you’re open to risk, experimentation, and resilience — exactly what they want in a team that thrives on incident response and uptime challenges.
