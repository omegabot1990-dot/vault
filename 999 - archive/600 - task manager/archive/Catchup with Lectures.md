Are they seen mostly in terms of 'individualised' or structural issues? What role do the notions of 'fairness' and 'justice' play in this domain? How can they be safeguarded? Is the notion of 'intersectionality' relevant - if yes, in what ways; if not, how come? Be ready to discuss this in class by using examples from your domain. This work builds up to your Assignment 3 submission and Final Project.==
