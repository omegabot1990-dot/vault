#### Project Proposal Presentations

On October 15th and, if necessary, on October 22nd   
each group is expected to give a 5-minute presentation   
using (4 slides) addressing:

1. Title of the project + group members (1 – 5 members)
2. Problem description
3. Challenges, novelty, etc.
4. What will be the goal for the Final Project Presentation/Demo

This slide does not have to be presented.
