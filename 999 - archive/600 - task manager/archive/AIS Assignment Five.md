Dunne and Raby (2013) outline some key changes that have happened since the 1970s, which, according to them, "_make imaginative, social, and political speculation_" at the time of publishing their book "_more difficult and less likely_". They conclude, "_Now, a younger generation doesn’t dream, it hopes; it hopes that we will survive, that there will be water for all, that we will be able to feed everyone, that we will not destroy ourselves._” p.9. 

How do you relate to such a statement personally and professionally? Reflect briefly on how you are positioned in relation to the contexts they describe (you can draw on the concept of _positionality;_ refer to Class 7 slides, if necessary).

Benjamin (2024) calls for the need to create 'new stories' (p.17) as a way to bring more just futures for everyone. According to her, what is the role of critical thinking and liberating imagination in this process? Connect her concerns about 'arrested imagination' (p. 39) with the concerns about 'thoughtlessness' that Browne (2023) describes building up on the work of Hanna Arendt. Explain how they, according to the authors, prevent creating different futures. How do you relate to this line of thinking?

Word count: Flexible. Most importantly, you understand the author's arguments and share your reflection. I would not expect that you need more than 500 words in total, but if you do, go at it. We will look for 1) an understanding of the authors' perspectives and connecting those to 2) your own reflection about the times and the world you live in.
