From Lin et al. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467):

- Chapter 1. Introduction (~15 pages)

**Additional background knowledge:**

As mentioned in the study guide, basic prior knowledge of data structures, machine learning, probability theory, text representation (embeddings), and linear algebra (vector spaces) is recommended.

If you do not have any knowledge about embeddings yet, I can refer you to some materials from my Text Mining course:

- Lecture 3 (2nd half of the video) about word2vec: [video lecture](https://weblectures.leidenuniv.nl/Mediasite/Channel/fwn2324-4343TXTMN-TextMining/watch/2d291d293171474baf77d9aa2533c8c91d "video lecture").
- Lecture 3 about neural NLP and transfer learning (you can skip over the technical details): [video lecture](https://weblectures.leidenuniv.nl/Mediasite/Channel/fwn2324-4343TXTMN-TextMining/watch/85124976c0a044ab9dc70866f543a2d61d "video lecture").
