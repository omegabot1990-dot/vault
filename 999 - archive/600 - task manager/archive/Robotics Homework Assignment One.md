I think H1 and H1-2 humanoid robots by [Unitree](https://www.unitree.com/h1) are impressive. The most interesting part is that they have released an open source dataset that can help the models move with never-before-seen fluidity, replicating complex dance moves. Even though they look a little funny while dancing they can execute movements with greater realism, achieving better adaptation to different environments and tasks.
