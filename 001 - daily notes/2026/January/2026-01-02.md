## Progress

- Worked on Python
- Worked on D2L
	- Revised Linear Algebra
	- Read Calculus
	- Read Auto Diff
	- Read Documentation
- Revised LLM from Scratch, PyTorch
- Updated Calendar
- Checked for relevant Chrome tabs on iPhone.
- Read Prompting a Smaller-Scale LLM for Goal-Oriented Emotional Support Dialogue Generation.
	- Methodology is elaborately written, mostly prompt engineering.
	- Results were analysed in depth, with many graphs. 
	- No significant contribution, but very long and verbose. Maybe that's the expectation.

## Plan

- Python
- D2L
	- Revise Preliminaries, Linear Algebra
	- Read Calculus, Auto Diff, Probability and Statistics and Documentation
- Work on LLM from Scratch
- Check out https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/state-of-llms-2025.
- Read Prompting a Smaller-Scale LLM for Goal-Oriented Emotional Support Dialogue Generation.
- Check out the LIACS thesis papers from last year.
